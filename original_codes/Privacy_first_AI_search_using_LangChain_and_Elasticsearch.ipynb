              " \"The N-1 starfighter, was a sleek single-pilot craft used by the Naboo and demonstrated the marriage of art and function present in Naboo technology. Buffed chromium finishes on the craft's forward surfaces glinted in the sun for fly-bys and parades, and represented the royalty of Naboo, complementing the Royal Starship. The N-1's chromium stood in stark contrast to its overall yellow finish.\\n\",\n",
              " \"The craft carried two J-type engines, which rendered the starfighter an agile craft, and a Nubian Monarc C-4 hyperdrive engine, and had a single on-board astromech droid which was mounted on the top of the craft. It featured an autopilot system and shielding, along with offensive weaponry that consisted of two blaster cannons and integrated proton torpedo launchers, with one double proton torpedo magazine, that could carry ten proton torpedoes. It could attain a maximum speed of 1,100 kph and was eleven meters in length. The ship's central rat-tail acted as a power charger collector, and received energy from onboard generators when it was not in use. The ships two outer finials served as heat sinks for the engines.\\n\",\n",
              " \"In use since at least the days of the High Republic Era, the N-1 starfighter was originally built by the Naboo, and was most notably used during the Trade Federation invasion of the planet. During the invasion, the pilots of Bravo Squadron flew the N-1 during the final assault against the Droid Control Ship Vuutun Palaa. Young Anakin Skywalker fired a pair of torpedoes into its starboard main reactor, effectively destroying it from within. They later joined in the celebration on the planet below, flying overhead Naboo's capital of Theed.\\n\",\n",
              " \"A decade later, three N-1s were used to escort Senator Padmé Amidala to Coruscant in order to vote on the Military Creation Act. Their Royal Starship held a decoy senator, and Amidala flew in one of the starfighters. They landed without incident, but the bounty hunter Zam Wesell hit the ship shortly after, destroying it and killing the senator's double; one of the three N-1s was also knocked off the landing platform by flying debris. N-1s remained in Naboo service during the Clone Wars, with several being kept in Theed Hangar during this time. During the war, Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano trained Amidala in starfighter combat, with Amidala flying an all-chrome N-1.\\n\",\n",
              " \"Years later, following the climactic Battle of Endor, N-1 starfighters flew in celebration after the Galactic Empire's second Death Star was destroyed. Shortly thereafter, Imperial agents received posthumous orders from Emperor Palpatine to commence the destruction of Naboo via weather manipulation as part of Operation: Cinder. Rebel leader Leia Organa, ace pilot Shara Bey, and Naboo's own Queen Soruna flew three long-abandoned N-1 fighters in the Theed Hangar into space to destroy the Imperial satellites that were causing the extreme weather conditions.\\n\",\n",

N-1 starfighters were later added to Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi as part of the celebration on Naboo in the ending montage in the DVD release.\\n',\n",
              " \"The N-1 starfighter was designed by artist Doug Chiang, and it was one of his favorite designs. At the start of the design phase, the ship had the angular design aesthetic prevalent in the original trilogy. However, Chiang decided that Naboo's ships should have an aquatic feel because Naboo had a lot of water. Chiang thought that the ship would land on water, so he designed the ship to have a boat-like hull bottom and not have landing pads. He loved the idea of a really sleek boat form. Chiang knew that George Lucas loved F1 cars and F1 boats, and he found the F1 cars' lines to be striking. Chiang decided to turn the look of an F1 boat into a ship, which started the evolution of the ships's design.\\n\",\n",
              " \"Chiang knew that the ship would need to be functionally practical and also have the elegant flavor that Lucas wanted. In the design, Chiang turned the F1 boats' two pontoons into jet engines. Chiang designed the engines with a really long spike to mirror a fish's tail spike in order to give the ship a fishlike quality. Chiang massaged all of the details to fully complete the ship.\\n\",\n",
              " \"Chiang wasn't sure that the ship would make it into The Phantom Menace because it had a risky design. The ship ultimately made it into the film because it was iconic, simple to read, fresh, and the audience could tell what it was. Lucas liked the design and wanted to go further by giving the ship a bold color.\\n\",\n",

After the Clone Wars, she helped establish a network of various rebel cells against the Galactic Empire. Tano was discovered on her homeworld of Shili by Jedi Master Plo Koon, who brought her to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant to receive Jedi training. Following the outbreak of the Clone Wars, Jedi Grand Master Yoda assigned the young Tano to be the Padawan learner of Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, who nicknamed her \"Snips\" when she joined him at the Battle of Christophsis. Whereas Tano was eager to prove herself, Skywalker had a reputation for recklessness, and they had a rather difficult start as master and apprentice. Yet they worked together to rescue Rotta, the son of crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure, and returned Rotta to his father, thus facilitating a crucial alliance between the Hutt Clan and the Galactic Republic.\\n',\n",

In her first command position at the Battle of Ryloth, Tano disobeyed orders and lost her entire squadron of pilots, but she rebounded and helped secure a victory at Ryloth. Her assignments pitted her against a variety of opponents, from General Grievous and Sith apprentice Asajj Ventress to bounty hunters such as Cad Bane and Aurra Sing. Over time, she matured into a respected leader, contributing to key Republic victories like the Second Battle of Geonosis and the Battle of Mon Cala.

In a stark turn of events, Tano was framed for the bombing of the Jedi Temple hangar and other homicides, and she escaped into the Coruscant Underworld to clear her name. Though she formed an unlikely alliance with Asajj Ventress, she was detained by Republic forces and was consequently barred from the Jedi Order. Ultimately, Skywalker uncovered the true culprit, Tano's friend, and fellow Padawan Barriss Offee, and prevented his former apprentice from being convicted of sedition. Nevertheless, the ordeal dislodged Tano's faith in the Jedi. She refused the Jedi High Council's offer to rejoin the Order, instead departing in search of a new path. Tano briefly returned to lead Republic forces during the Siege of Mandalore and faced Maul and his allies.

Tano took a particular interest in Syndulla\\'s rebels because one of their members, a Jedi named Kanan Jarrus, had begun to train his own Padawan, Ezra Bridger. In addition, Tano\\'s efforts against the Empire brought her into contact with the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Vader—who, unknown to her, was actually her former master, Anakin Skywalker—as well as the Imperial Inquisitors known as the Fifth Brother and the Seventh Sister, but it also gave her the chance to reunite with Rex.

Having been granted the rank of Padawan, which made her a Jedi Commander under the Jedi Military Integration Act, she demonstrated an eagerness to prove herself worthy to be his apprentice.

Tano held her own against Kenobi and Skywalker as the Son and the Daughter fought. Eventually, Tano stole the Dagger from Kenobi and, smirking, gave it to the Son. The Son, claiming Tano was no longer of use, drained her life Force and instantly killed her.\\n\",\n",

Instead, the Daughter lunged and took the blow, and the horrified Son dropped the weapon as he saw that the Daughter was mortally wounded. The Daughter told Skywalker that she could save Tano if she used him as a conduit to channel her life force into her. They completed the procedure as the Daughter died, bringing Ahsoka back to life and purging her of the darkness.\\n',\n",
              " 'Ahsoka was then able to repair the ship as Skywalker faced the Son, and as the Father took his own life, Skywalker killed the Son.

Piell carried vital information alongside Captain Wilhuff Tarkin involving the secret hyperspace lanes called the Nexus Route, which the Separatists sought to obtain. Upon his capture, he was taken to an ancient prison known as the Citadel, which had been designed to detain Jedi if any had strayed from their path. In order to rescue Master Piell, Skywalker, Kenobi, and Koon devised a plan to rescue him, and, as they exited the briefing room, Tano ran up beside them, apologizing for being late, citing that she had just heard about the briefing and asked for clarification on their rescue of Piell. As Skywalker stopped, Koon commented that Tano and Skywalker had much to discuss as Kenobi and Koon left to leave the two alone.\\n',\n",

However, Tano argued that this wasn't fair and that Skywalker was merely being protective, asking how she was going to learn if Skywalker was not willing for her to risk herself. However, Skywalker continued on by saying that this wasn't a mission to be teaching lessons to a Padawan and that it was meant as a do or die type of mission, not willing to share this risk with his Padawan. As he walked away, Tano grew increasingly frustrated.\\n\",\n",
              " \"Shortly afterwards, Tano consulted Master Koon for guidance on Skywalker's decision. In response to her inquiry, Koon simply informed her that it was Skywalker's decision to decide whether or not she should be allowed to go. However, Tano once again cited her belief that Skywalker was being overprotective, saying that he had been choosing which assignments she could partake in. Koon then responded by once again saying that he was her master to which Tano said that it should be her choice when she wanted to risk her life. With that, Koon began to ponder her argument.\\n\",\n",
              " 'Eventually, Koon agreed with Tano\\'s sentiment and, in a way, assigned her to the mission. After being \"assigned,\" Tano was frozen in carbonite and placed aboard their stolen Sheathipede-class transport shuttle alongside Skywalker, Kenobi, and the clones. As they approached Lola Sayu, the planet the Citadel was housed upon, Commandant Osi Sobeck, the warden of the prison, grew increasingly suspicious of their true cargo and ordered for his droids to scan for lifeforms. However, after doing a full scan of the ship, the scanners came up empty, showing that the Republic\\'s ruse had worked. As they arrived on the planet, the shuttle deviated from where it was assigned to land, choosing instead to hide within the volcanic canyons of the planet and unload their \"cargo.\"\\n',\n",

As Kenobi woke up alongside him, he noted that he believed he must have been given carbon sickness as he was seeing Tano was with them. In response, Skywalker confirmed to him that his sight was fine and that Tano's hearing was the thing that needed assistance instead. In defense, Tano explained that she had received orders from Koon and that she thought he had known about it. Skywalker grew more disgruntled with her as he told her that Koon had not told him about her joining the mission, which Tano followed up by saying that he had already been in carbonite when the decision had been made. Pointing at Tano, he once again informed her that he had specifically told her not to come, but Tano defended herself by saying that Skywalker had taught her that following direct orders wasn't always the right decision. With that, Kenobi walked over and commented on Skywalker's teaching style before welcoming Tano to the mission, leading Tano to smile. After Kenobi's inquiry, the discussion ended.\\n\",\n",

Once Cody finished preparing his pack, the two made their way to the cliff surrounding the Citadel. Arriving at a safe distance to avoid detection, Kenobi and Skywalker stopped to survey the cliff they were intending to climb in order to make their way to an entry point into the Citadel. Kenobi suggested that they use ascension cables, but was met with disapproval from Skywalker as he noted the electromines dotting the cliff face and that the ascension cables would have nothing to grab onto without hitting the electromines, which would notify the entire prison of their presence. With this, Rex suggested that they freeclimb it which was met with approval from both Kenobi and Skywalker as the group continued their journey to the Citadel.\\n',\n",

As they continued their climb, Kenobi traveled up to the platform where the entry point the group wished to enter through was located, but was stopped when several droids appeared through the entry point, forcing him to tell the rest of the group to remain silent, causing them to briefly pause their climb. As the droids returned inside, they activated a ray shield, which Kenobi noted to the rest of the group, leading Skywalker to become distressed as the ray shield wasn\\'t originally in the plan. Continuing her climb, Tano noted that an opening was near the door and that she might be able to squeeze through the ventilation ducts and disable to ray shield. Skywalker then met her proposal with approval after an inquiry from Kenobi and she made her way to the shaft and entered, arriving just outside the ray shielded door. As she exited, she checked for any droid patrols, noticing none and made her way to the door controls, simply pressing a single button and deactivating the ray shield. As Skywalker, entered she tried to show off to him, noting that she could handle herself. However, as the rest of the group finished making their way up to the platform, a clone named \"Charger\" lost his grip on the cliff and began tumbling down towards the lava below, hitting an electromine on his way down and alerting the entire facility to the group\\'s presence. With that, all security protocols were activated, the entire facility was placed on lockdown, and Sobeck\\'s special units were assigned to hunt the group down.\\n',\n",

However, an electrified wall soon activated, forcing the group to run to cover, and killing \"Longshot,\" not managing to take cover in time. Even so, Kenobi ordered for the group to keep moving. As Master Piell was being tortured, the group arrived just in time to save him before an EV-series medical droid would\\'ve removed his one remaining eye. As the group arrived, Skywalker freed Master Piell from his containment field while Kenobi cradled him back to the ground. As he stood back up, he confirmed he had not revealed the coordinates of the Nexus Route as Kenobi handed him his lightsaber back. However, Master Piell also confirmed that he only had half of the coordinates of the Nexus Route and that his captain had the other half, forcing the group to free them as well. With this, Skywalker was forced to come up with a new plan for escaping the facility and, with that, the group made their way to the second cell.\\n',\n",

During the battle, one of the commando droids tackled Tano and wrestled her to the ground before she managed to cut off its head, disabling it. Shortly afterward, Sobeck employed the use of ringing noise, distracting the group, and activating a magnetic field, allowing him to take their weapons and attracting Skywalker\\'s cybernetic hand as Sobeck began to electrocute him, leading Tano to call out towards him. Soon after, more of Sobeck\\'s special units arrived as Sobeck announced that they were going to be his \"guests\" for a very long time as they appeared to have been captured.\\n',\n",

Even so, the group continued this tactic, causing the droids' shots to miss their targets as the clones attempted to destroy them using their bare hands; however, the droids instead knocked them to the ground. As they did this, Skywalker managed to grab his lightsaber as Sobeck continued to electrify him and deactivate the magnetic field, returning each weapon to its respective group member and leading Skywalker to fall back towards the floor. With that, the group easily managed to destroy the commando droids as they continued their way towards the officers' cell. Before Rex left, he shot the camera Sobeck had been using to watch them, causing him to lose track of where they were.\\n\",\n",

As the rest of the group arrived in the cell, Tarkin, Piell's captain, noted their presence and asked how they were going to get out of the facility. With that, Kenobi offered a solution where he and Skywalker split up, assigning Piell and Tarkin to separate groups in case either was captured. Although briefly rejecting the idea, Tarkin eventually gave in after an inquiry from Piell and was assigned to Skywalker's group alongside Tano as Piell went with Kenobi's group. Kenobi's group intended to cause a distraction on their way to the landing pad to meet with their shuttle while Skywalker's group used the old fortress tunnels in order to maneuver around the facility and make it towards the pipeline where they too would be rescued by the shuttle.\\n\",\n",
              " \"While Kenobi and Piell created a diversion, Skywalker, using old archive data, led his group to one of the tunnels in order to allow them to exit the facility. As they made their way out, Tano rushed ahead to make sure the tunnel was free of droids, discovering none and notifying the group as much. With that, Tano made her way back to the rest of the group as they traversed the old tunnel. As they continued to walk across the tunnel, Skywalker asked R2 if he and his battle droids were ready to depart as Tano surveyed the tunnel. Continuing to see if any droids occupied the tunnel, Tano continued to serve as a lookout for the group as a probe droid appeared, but was subsequently cut down by Skywalker before being able to alert Sobeck of their presence. After she looked towards the lava below, Tano openly questioned a sudden comment from Tarkin, who told her that he admired the design of the fortress. To this, Tarkin noted that the ongoing incident showed that it is effective at its job, but that it was a pity that the fortress had been captured by the Separatists, which Skywalker responded to Tano's responsive stare by telling her that Tarkin had a point. However, Tano gave him a bewildered look upon him saying this. With that, Skywalker informed Tano that he would be departing the group for a short while and that he needed her to lead it for the time being which led Tano to ask were he was going to which he noted that he needed to protect their flank since Kenobi was not with them. With that, Tano looked towards Skywalker and noted that it might have been a good thing she came after all while possessing a proud look on her face.\\n\",\n",
              " \"As they continued walking, Tarkin expressed his doubt in Tano's ability to lead the group to Rex to which Rex noted that he trusted her after the many missions the two had been on together. However, as the pair's conversation continued, the group came across a dead end in the tunnel. Just then, super battle droids began to appear from their flank, forcing Tano to activate her lightsabers and defend the group. As she did this, Skywalker swooped down and cut one of the super battle droids in half and did the same to the other. However commando droids, wielding personal energy shields, soon arrived, forcing them back into action. Tano then defended herself by saying that she thought it was a dead end, which ended up being to her detriment as Skywalker informed her that if Koon had indeed assigned her to the mission, he would've briefed her on the plan. However, Tano ignored this and instead ran to the wall and began placing thermal detonators onto it. Thinking that she had placed enough, she ran back into the action with two Class-A thermal detonators that had been leftover and used them to destroy the attacking commando droids as the wall blew up behind the group. With that, Tano walked past Skywalker, smiling at him, as the group continued its journey.\\n\",\n",
              " \"Arriving at the pipeline, Tano rushed ahead to gain a better perspective on it as Skywalker explained where the pipeline led and the plan for their escape. He then opened the hatch as the group had to shield their noses from the noxious fumes coming out of the pipeline. Tano then ventured into the pipeline, being the first to enter. As the group made it up the pipeline, Tano climbed from the outside and used her acrobatic skills to maneuver around and make it to the top of the pipeline. Cautiously skimming across it, Tano eventually stopped and informed the group that she thought she found a way out. Opening the hatch, she notified the group that there were no droids present as well as informing them that R2 had not yet arrived with the shuttle. As she attempted to climb out of the hatch, however, two battle droids pointed their blasters at her, but she easily managed to destroy them using her lightsabers, but soon discovered many more battle droids as well as crab droids advancing on their position. Even so, the group made their way out of the pipeline and towards the advancing droids. As Tarkin and the clones exited the pipeline, Tano and Skywalker defended them, deflecting as many of the droids' blaster bolts as was possible using their lightsabers. However, the group was soon forced to escape as they became overwhelmed by the number of droids. As Tano took cover along with the rest of the group, Skywalker took a thermal detonator and threw it at the hatch, closing it and destroying the entire pipeline along with the droids. With that, Skywalker informed them that they would now be following plan B, which was to meet up with the shuttle where Kenobi was supposed to be located.\\n\",\n",
              " \"As Skywalker's group arrived at the landing platform, they discovered Kenobi's group pinned down by several turrets surrounding the shuttle. In response to this, Skywalker's group was forced to take cover alongside Kenobi's group. While pinned down, Tano noted that the ship was surrounded to which Tarkin offered a solution in the way of a full-scale assault on the droids. However, Kenobi noted that if they did that the turrets would simply destroy the ship and their only chance of escape, but Tarkin offered up a counter solution where they take over the turrets and decimate the droids surrounding the shuttle. As they continued their conversation, Skywalker pointed out the STAPs headed for them as they began to fire upon them, destroying the crates behind them and forcing the four Jedi to ignite their lightsabers.\\n\",\n",
              " 'The Jedi managed to use this to their advantage, however, as Skywalker managed to grab hold of one of the STAPs in an attempt to destroy the turrets. However, more droid reinforcements continued to arrive alongside several commando droids, one of which climbed into one of the turrets and attempted to destroy the shuttle. Seeing this, ARC trooper CT-1409 \"Echo\" ran out into the open in an attempt to claim the shuttle, but the shuttle was instead destroyed and Echo was thought dead; however, the debris from the destruction of the shuttle managed to destroy the turret the commando droid was manning. With the shuttle now destroyed, the now once again combined group was forced to make a tactical retreat.\\n',\n",
              " 'As the group escaped, Kenobi and Skywalker contacted the Jedi on Coruscant and informed them that they were going to need a rescue since their shuttle had been destroyed. Finally finding cover, Tano conversed with one of the rescued officers as Kenobi, Piell, and Skywalker discussed how they were going to make it to the rendezvous point and decided that they would just have to keep moving. With that, the group moved out, making their way towards the rendezvous point, believing that they still had a chance to escape.\\n',\n",
              " \"As the group passed by a lava cave, Tano asked what the group's next move was to which Skywalker said that they were going to have to fight their way off of Lola Sayu, leading to Kenobi asking for someone to contact the Council and see when they were planning rescue them, which Piell took responsibility of. With that, R2 displayed a hologram of Windu who said that he was glad to see Piell alive. Skywalker then walked over to them and asked when they were planning on rescuing them to which Windu informed them that Koon had already left for Lola Sayu. Adding onto this, Yoda informed them that gunships would arrive to extract them, but that only a small window would be there for them to be rescued, so they had to the rendezvous point. Yoda then informed them where the rendezvous point would be—a small island surrounded by lava. Windu then wished for the Force to be with them and ended the transmission. As the transmission ended, the group was ambushed by commando droids but easily destroyed them with the use of a timely thermal detonator from Fives. With that, the group moved out to reach the rendezvous point in time with Kenobi noting that more droids were surely on their way.\\n\",\n",
              " \"The group was soon discovered by Sobeck's droid forces, which led Tano to exclaim that the droids were boxing them in. In order to escape, Skywalker and Kenobi used their ascension guns to carry the members of the group with no weapon down the cliff they were in front of. While doing so, Tano defended them against the droids along with the rest of the group as R2 ordered for his droids to attack the enemy. The rest of the group took this opportunity to escape and used the ascension cables to carry themselves down the cliff. Finally making it to the surface, the commando droids continued to fire on them above after easily destroying R2's droids as the group attempted to make it through an opening into a cave while Cody and Skywalker covered their escape.\\n\",\n",

Looking back at Tarkin, Tano sneered and rolled her eyes at him before facing forward once more to continue moving. As she ducked under an outstretched rock, Tano asked why Piell had to share half of the coordinates of the Nexus Route with Tarkin, believing he wasn't grateful they had rescued him. In response, Skywalker informed her that Tarkin believed that the Jedi should not be in charge of leading the Grand Army of the Republic in the Clone Wars to which Tano said that his beliefs were ridiculous. Skywalker continued, debating with Kenobi about the role of the Jedi Code within war. As they continued walking, the group heard the howl of the anoobas, which led Tano to ask the rest of the group if they had heard the howl as well. Attempting to outrun the anoobas, Skywalker later told Tarkin that it was not wise to disobey Piell, especially for his career, while Tano watched. In response, Tarkin said that he stood by his principles no matter the circumstance and that his career was not to worry about since the chancellor favored him to which Skywalker said that he and the chancellor were also friends. However, Kenobi told them to hurry up or they'd miss their rendezvous and the two's conversation ended.\\n\",\n",

To this, Piell said that they might be able to get the anoobas to pass by, but they'd need a distraction in order to do so to which Skywalker offered himself up as well as Kenobi who inquired by the way of a fake cough. Tano then went with the rest of the group to hide in the cave as Kenobi and Skywalker walked with R2 through a misty path of rocks. As the anoobas arrived along with several commando droids riding STAPs, Tano and the rest of the group went to spring the trap; however, before they could arrive, crab droids appeared off the side of the cliff and attacked the group, quickly killing one of the liberated clones.\\n\",\n",

Tano soon managed to destroy one of the other crab droids that had arrived while the two were overlooked by one of the anoobas. It quickly sprung into action and tackled Piell, forcing Tano to attempt to save him. Tano was too late, however, as, after using the Force to push the anooba away, Piell laid dying on the ground. As Tano reattached her lightsabers to her belt, she checked for Piell's vitals and exclaimed that she needed to get help, but was stopped by Piell who told her that he needed to tell her his half of the Nexus Route coordinates. Tano attempted to tell him that she should go get Skywalker or Kenobi, but Piell insisted that she hear them instead. To this, Tano admitted that she hadn't truly been assigned to the mission, but Piell did not care, informing her that now she was one of the most important pieces of the mission whether she was meant to be here or not and that she give his half of the coordinates of the Nexus Route only to the Jedi Council.

The group then brought him to a lavafall where Kenobi and Skywalker used the Force to drop his body into the lava and took a moment to honor him before they moved on. As the group continued their journey to the rendezvous point, they finally came across the island where they were meant to be extracted, Cody and Skywalker used their ascension guns to launch a cable so that they could climb over to the island as it was surrounded by lava.

When Dooku threatened to execute the slaves if they did not stop their attack, Republic reinforcements, the 104th Battalion led by Plo Koon arrived to help. Tano and Skywalker then split up with Tano rendezvousing with the slaves and her master disabling the defense turrets.

Bonteri accused Count Dooku of being responsible for his mother's death, and Tano left the meeting to protect Bonteri from possible retribution. Sneaking aboard a Separatist landing craft, Tano intervened when Dooku ordered Bonteri's execution via hologram. Tano was intent on bringing Bonteri to Coruscant to be granted amnesty, but Bonteri had other plans.

When Kryze left them both alone before their meeting with Pre Vizsla, Tano learned of Bonteri's plan to convince Death Watch, who recently had a falling out with the Sith Lord, to assassinate Dooku. Tano warned Bonteri that Death Watch still had their own agenda and could not trusted, but Bonteri kissed her to interrupt her as Vizsla arrived. Vizsla forced Tano to work alongside natives that Death Watch used as slave labor. Later, when Death Watch began to pillage and burn a village, Tano attempted to fight back but was imprisoned. However, when Vizsla drew the Darksaber, intent on killing Tano, R2, who had been forced to repair Death Watch droids they used for entertainment in a fighting ring, uses a smoke screen as a diversion and slips Tano her lightsabers that he recovered from the ship. Tano acrobatically freed herself and beheaded a group of Mandalorians approaching her before dueling Vizsla. When R2 set the droids on their masters, the three escaped from Vizsla.

However, the Separatist response to the growing resistance was swift. Dooku sent General Kalani to reinforce their grip on the planet and ordered the former King, Ramsis Dendup, to be executed. Saw went in to attempt to save the King himself, was captured. Tano then assisted Steela in planning a breakout of the two during the public execution.

Tano decided to call in a favor from Skywalker, who made a deal with Hondo Ohnaka to get several rocket launchers delivered to the rebels. Ohnaka made the delivery himself, and the new weapons turned the tide of the battle. As the Rebels turned their new weaponry on the last of the gunships, Tano and Bonteri rushed to save the King from a force of commando droids.

As Kenobi understood the Senate would not let them provide aid to a neutral system, he elected to go to Mandalore alone.

She had fed Bowmani nano-droids that made him a living bomb. Their findings brushed over the possibility of a Jedi culprit. Turmond was incarcerated in a prison and guarded by Shock troopers. When Tano went to interview her, Offee used a Force choke on Turmond, which killed her and framed Tano. Offee continued her work of framing her friend and caused the deaths of several clone troopers.

Tano attempted to negotiate with them, but the clones attempted to detain her and she was forced to combat them, leaving most of the group unconscious before continuing towards the warehouse. Ventress departed at that point, reminding her to fulfill her end of the deal. Inside, Tano found the warehouse abandoned before being attacked by a figure in Ventress' bounty hunter gear. Unaware she was actually fighting her friend Offee, whom she thought was her ally, she believed the attacker was Ventress.

Skywalker reminded her that he had believed in and fought to prove her innocence, and although Tano accepted this, the situation was not about him. She felt she could not stay anymore and needed to find her own path away from the Jedi Order.

Following her departure, Skywalker continued to lament his Padawan's decision, and wondered if Amidala had the same thought.

Though Martez's only sparkers were already used on her freighter and there was no available stock. Stating that was not good and noting she needed to get out, she did not answer Martez after the mechanic asked if she was running from something.

Martez, who felt that the Jedi had forgotten about common people like her, admitted that the Jedi were not what she had imagined based on the stories she had heard, revealing that she wanted to get away from the war and Jedi aboard her starship with her older sister, Rafa.

Tano and Trace worked on the three binary loadlifters, with Tano reminding the mechanic to put the restraining bolt onto the droid. After Tano activated the droid she had been working on, she and Trace began a conversation about how people acted, with Martez mentioning her belief that some people were good, others were bad, and some were cross-wired like the loadlifter she had been building. By saying this, however, Tano realized they had been building Type II loadlifter droids and, after her Type II attacked and she shut it down, explained that the \"loadlifters\" units were actually frauds, being repurposed demolition droid which could cause violence.

The two located the droid and chased it, intending to grab the droid with the speeder's clamps and to use the blue off switch on the droid's face plate. After grabbing the type two, however, it began to climb, making Trace release the droid from the clamps and jump onto it herself. Although she managed to shut the unit down, the now lifeless body began to fall with Trace still holding on, forcing Tano to grab hold of it with the speeder's clamps. She quickly attached the vehicle's tow cable to nearby pipes to pull them up, but the droid and Trace proved to be too heavy. Before Trace could fall to her death, however, Tano secretly used the Force to help pull the vehicle up, with only a watching Twi'lek child realizing what she did.

Rafa then arrived to meet with them, revealing she had charged Lokann double the price, defending herself by saying they were not her property, someone else would have constructed them if they hadn't, and that it would have caused trouble for her and Trace. Although Trace was visibly disappointed, Rafa stated the credits had been used to pay off Son-El and gave money for new tools, hoping that would make it worth it.

When Tano asked why she would never have attended one of the schools, the mechanic noted that there were none where they lived, and that she would not be able to afford it. Trace then stated Rafa and her inherited the hangar the repair shop was in, claiming their parents had \"split,\" and that Rafa had won her store gambling.

Rafa reminded her sister that they could not rely on anyone\\'s help, seeing that Trace was beginning to trust Tano. After her sister had entered the Silver Angel, though, Rafa confronted Tano and asked what she was looking for. The former Padawan stated she did not have, as Rafa put it, an \"angle,\" unless maybe to keep the two siblings out of trouble. Rafa and her then entered the ship, but not without the older sibling implying Tano could be the trouble Trace needed to avoid. Now with all three inside the cockpit, the Silver Angel took off from the underworld portal, but Trace flew the ship into a restricted military lane. The Angel was soon hailed by a Star Destroyer that had both Skywalker and Yularen, the same admiral Tano had served with, aboard.

In response, Rafa only told her sister about their destination before they jumped to lightspeed. During their journey, however, Trace had forgotten to disengage the air brakes, making the Angel rumble, and Trace noted she had never been to hyperspace. Tano then learned that her friend had only ever piloted smaller vehicles meant for use on planets, allowing Rafa to quietly explain why she had wanted a different pilot. Once Tano pointed out the rumbling, Trace remembered to disable the air brakes, and the three finally arrived at the Akkadese Maelstrom, a massive cluster of debris and gas that surrounded their destination, the Outer Rim world of Kessel. Realizing they were heading to a planet infamous for its corruption, Tano asked Rafa what their job was. Rafa stated they were picking up medicine and tried to calm the former Padawan's worries when they reached the lush section of the planet. The three young women arrived at King Yaruba's palace, where they were greeted by his majordomo, Kinash Lock. Tano and the sisters were brought to a banquet, but, after learning the medicine was three containers of unrefined spice, the Force-sensitive noted that the substance could be used in illegal products. Lock denied her allegation, claiming their spice was used for medicine during the current time of war and that the Yaruba Family had always supported spreading health and joy.\\n\",\n",
              " \"As they left the palace, Tano tried to argue their mission was dangerous, as pirates often attacked Kessel transport craft, but Rafa believed the Angel was too small for any raiders to realize what their cargo was. Tano refused to yield, noting that pirates could deduce what they were carrying because they were leaving Kessel, and, to keep her past a secret, claimed she knew this from stories. The Martez sister simply responded that it meant she should have faith in Trace's piloting skills and boarded their freighter. Before Trace could join her sibling, Tano stopped her, telling her that she believed Rafa had wanted a different pilot because of the possible danger, but the pilot felt her sister had faith in her abilities. After Tano learned this was likely Rafa's first time running spice, she asked Trace how her sister could know what they were facing, but the pilot simply felt there was a first time for every task. With this, the two boarded the Angel, and the three young women traveled to the mining zone of Kessel, which more closely resembled the version of the planet Tano was familiar with. As they neared a landing platform, the three looked down to see what Trace initially thought were droids Yaruba had purchased, but Tano quickly realized the laborers toiling below them were slaves. Rafa disagreed, believing the Republic would not allow an operation as large as Kessel's to remain active, but Tano quietly noted that was not what the government would do.\\n\",\n",

Though annoyed by her sister's thoughts on Tano, Trace stated she would keep an eye on her friend before both went aboard. When the Angel jumped to hyperspace, however, Tano learned they were to deliver the spice to the Pyke crime lord Marg Krim on Oba Diah. Though Rafa questioned how the supposed mechanic knew about the Pyke Syndicate, Tano avoided the question and asserted that they could not make a deal with gangsters, warning Trace that the Pykes would take everything from her and kill her. As the pilot panicked at the thought of losing her starship, Tano, who felt they should take the spice to somewhere that would use it for medicine, debated what to do with their shipment with Rafa, who stated she needed the money to pay debts they owed on Coruscant, though Tano believed these debts had nothing to do with Trace. Determined to keep the Silver Angel and make sure neither Tano nor Rafa got their way, Trace suddenly dumped the spice containers into hyperspace, to the surprise of both her sister and the former Padawan, who had viewed her debate as an ethical discussion and had yet to figure out a way to settle their deal.\\n\",\n",

She told the sisters to pretend to drop the spice by giving the Pykes empty crates and that they would then flee the planet. Though both Trace and Rafa disliked her idea, neither had a better plan, and Tano also knew she had the Force at her disposal. When the trio arrived on Oba Diah, they were greeted by Krim, who had been waiting for them, his majordomo Fife, and a force of armed Pyke guards. The crime lord withheld Rafa\\'s payment, intending to verify they had brought him the spice, but Tano used a mind trick on the Pyke and his entourage, persuading Krim to give Rafa her credits and let them leave. Unfortunately for them, Fife was not as weak-minded as his peers and grew suspicious. As Tano prepared the Angel\\'s engines, Rafa avoided giving Fife the bin password by claiming they had already transmitted it. The majordomo was not convinced and, after blasting open the case, saw that the three had tricked them. As the trio tried to escape on the Angel, they were caught in a tractor beam and surrounded by Pyke forces. Seeing that they were trapped, Rafa said she would blame everything on Tano, although Trace noted all three of them had played a part in their current situation.\\n',\n",

Rafa joked that Tano\\'s morals made her sound like a Jedi, making her question what they would do if she was a member of the Order. Though Trace told them not to jest about the subject, Rafa realized her sister had never told Tano why they avoided the Jedi and other \"Topsiders.\" Unwilling to have the secret Force-sensitive argue about morality, she recounted that, during Cad Bane\\'s rescue of Ziro the Hutt several years earlier, the bounty hunter shot the engines of a cargo transport rising through an underworld portal to distract a team of pursuing Jedi. Trying to stop the starship from crashing into a populated landing platform, the Jedi instead steered it into the portal wall, the other side of which contained the Martez home. Their mother and father managed to get the siblings out of harm\\'s way, but they were caught and killed in the crash.\\n',\n",

She then stated that the Force would be with them, but the religious belief meant nothing to Martez sister. The Jedi then left, leaving the two alone to find a way to survive. Rafa recounted that she had spent every day since trying to build a new life for herself and Trace, believing they had been fine until her sister let Tano come with them.\\n\",\n",
              " 'Tano apologized for what had happened to them, but the three young women were interrupted by the Pyke guards, who demanded Rafa come with them. While Tano stood in front of the sisters to try to protect them and Rafa offered that they instead take Tano, the Pykes pushed past the former Padawan and Trace, taking the elder sister away for interrogation. As Rafa was tortured, Trace and Tano were left in the cell, where the mechanic admitted she and her sister had been on their own until Tano arrived. Trace also revealed she had helped her because it was something her mother would have believed in. Rafa, unconscious but having refused to give up information, was then thrown into the cell by the Pyke guards. Though Tano advised her friend to not make the Pykes angry, Trace demanded they tell her what had happened to Rafa and shoved a guard, who grabbed the mechanic to take her away for interrogation.\\n',\n",

Trace called for her friend to make sure Rafa was well before being taken to the interrogation room, where she pretended to faint to distract the guards, using the opportunity to steal a CC-420 pistol and escape the room, although several guards pursued her. After noticing the Pykes run down the hallway, Tano secretly used the Force to unlock the door before waking Rafa. Informing the Martez sister that the Pykes had taken Trace and that they needed to flee, they escaped the cell, which the secret Force user claimed was opened by a power outage. As they searched for Trace, they eventually ran into the escaping mechanic, who had been heading back to the cell to break them out.\\n\",\n",
              " 'Reunited, the three made their way to an outside platform, and Trace blasted a barrel Tano and Rafa had knocked over to clear away the pursuing guards. Their next challenge came from a retracting bridge; although Rafa made it across in time, Tano had to use the Force to help push Trace across, and, while Rafa was willing to leave Tano behind, she was able to Force jump over the gap. While the older Martez sister recognized that it had not been a normal feat, they nevertheless needed the run from two more Pykes guards, who had arrived just before Trace made it across the bridge. The three made their way to the city gate, during which time Tano helped the sisters take out a Pyke guard in order to steal his stun baton, and she continued to debate their situation with Rafa.\\n',\n",
              " \"Understanding that the syndicate's reputation was at stake, the former Padawan recognized that the Pykes had no desire to let them escape, so Rafa had Tano head to disable the gate while she and Trace went to distract the guards. The Martez sister claimed to give Tano the job because of her resourcefulness, though the former Padawan also believed it was because Rafa thought it was more difficult. As her friend left for the control tower, Trace speculated that her sister and Tano were getting along better, but Rafa denied that. Tano was able to sneak into the control tower and managed to dispatch the control room's guards in physical combat, but she quickly saw that the Martez sisters had gotten into a firefight with the Pykes outside. After opening the gates and traveling down, she secretly used the Force to pull the two guards into the open, giving Trace the chance to shoot both of them. Tano then called the sisters forward, and the three young women escaped into the city.\\n\",\n",

Rafa changed the topic to question Tano about why she was interested in helping, although they were soon interrupted by a begging Gotal. Rafa claimed to have no credits, and she and Tano left him so they could catch up to Trace. Once they had, Rafa again asked what she wanted, so Tano informed the Martez sister that she made it her duty to help those in need, a trait that Rafa admitted sounded like her mother. She confided in Tano that she was simply trying to do what was best for her sister and herself. Trace then informed her friend and sister that she had in fact found the Angel, but the trio was spotted by the Pykes, who had been helped in their search by the angered Gotal beggar, after Trace and Rafa had argued about whether to use the Angel to escape. The three ran through the crowded street while pursued and under blaster fire, unknowingly attracting the attention of a hooded Mandalorian Nite Owl, who was on planet for a mission with Bo-Katan Kryze, the very Death Watch lieutenant Tano had fought during the battle on Carlac earlier in the war.\\n',\n",

As the sisters were captured, Tano continued to escape through the city, unknowingly being watched by Kryze, who was unsure if the Force-sensitive was in fact Tano, Ursa Wren, and a third Mandalorian Nite Owl. Although Wren feared her presence could compromise their mission on Oba Diah, Kryze also recognized that they shared an enemy in the rogue Sith Lord Maul, who still had control over Mandalore. Thus, Kryze decided they would keep track of the former Padawan's movements.\\n\",\n",

After discretely taking out a guard, the former Padawan took control of a construction vehicle, interrupting the planned execution by ramming the repulsorcraft into the Pykes and using its frontal cannons. Although she cleared away most of the Pyke guards in their path, Fife—who had purposely drawn Tano into a trap with the execution—returned with a cannon-equipped landspeeder. The cannon downed Tano's replusorcraft, preventing their escape and allowing them to be subsequently surrounded by Pyke guards.\\n\",\n",

Tano and Kryze also developed a friendship, with Kryze becoming a combat mentor to the former Jedi. After some time, Tano and the Mandalore resistance managed to pinpoint Maul\\'s location on Mandalore with the help of the information Tano managed to retrieve from the Pykes on Oba Diah. Knowing they did not have the numbers for a siege of Mandalore, Tano and Kryze contacted Skywalker and Kenobi, who were finishing up a battle on the planet Yerbana, for their assistance in the siege.

Responding to Skywalker's inquiry, Tano said she was alright, but knew that they did not have time to make irrelevant conversation and needed to divulge the important information she and Kryze had immediately. After Kenobi asked what this information was, Tano explained that they had finally managed to locate Maul and that they might be able to capture him if they moved swiftly.\\n\",\n",

Kryze, embarrassed, explained that she didn't have the numbers that would be needed for a siege of this size and needed the assistance of the Republic's clones in order for a complete lockdown of Sundari. To gain this, she proposed that she would give them Maul once he was captured and that she would take the leadership role on Mandalore once the siege concluded. Nevertheless, Kenobi explained that if they aided them, it would break ancient treaties between the Republic and Mandalorians and that the two sides would once again be drawn into a war. To this, Kryze asked them what one more war was, but Skywalker explained that they didn't want another war when they were already fighting in the Clone Wars. With this, Kenobi explained that he would ask for the Jedi Council's guidance in this matter, but Kryze, desperate for help, yelled at him that there was no time to speak with them and attempted to incite Kenobi's feelings for Satine, whom Maul had murdered months prior. She scornfully looked at Kenobi as he walked away to speak with the Council, refusing to allow his feelings to control his actions.

Before they parted ways once more, Skywalker presented Tano with a box which contained one of her most prized former possessions. However, just as he presented her with the box, the ship's emergency alarm went off, alerting all Republic personnel aboard to get ready for battle. Kenobi rushed in, informing Skywalker and Rex to prepare all forces and that they would be entering hyperspace shortly to help ward off Grievous' surprise attack on Coruscant. Kenobi informed Skywalker that the Chancellor was under the protection of Togruta Jedi Master Shaak Ti, but that Windu had lost contact with her. Growing annoyed by their political games, Tano asked if her former masters were just going to abandon the Mandalorians. Somewhat shocked by the accusation, Kenobi urged Tano to understand that they were needed at Coruscant as this was a pivotal moment in the Clone Wars. This only annoyed Tano more as she believed that the Jedi were still playing politics, and noted that was why the people of the galaxy had lost faith in them.\\n\",\n",

However, Skywalker offered a compromise where he would divide the 501st into a new division led by Rex who would be promoted to Commander while Tano served as an advisor. Tano accepted her new position and, with Kenobi's approval, the Siege of Mandalore could begin.

As she looked at Skywalker, he said they were maybe a little better than when she had had them last. She then briefly practiced with them once more. Beginning to depart, Skywalker looked at Tano and said that with any luck their missions would be over soon and they would be able to reunite once more after their conclusion.

As he informed her that this attack would make her an enemy to the citizens of Sundari, she ended the transmission, noting that she didn\\'t care. Tano turned to address Kryze and commented on how much of a difference there was between her and her sister, Satine.

Before the gunship crashed, she hitched a short ride as the super commandos on the surface prepared to fire at her. Jumping down onto a platform, the gunship exploded behind her as the super commandos began to fire at her, forcing her to deflect their blaster bolts, allowing her to kill several of them.

Maul then began to wonder if Sidious' plan was finally coming to fruition, but did not explain as much to Tano.

On top of this, she informed him that he had been programmed to turn against her and that his mind had been altered by the inhibitor chip, continuing by saying that she could help him. As Rex took aim at R7 and asked where Tano was, she appeared behind him, with R7 electrocuting him in order to bring him to the medical bay.

With this, Tano began to leave, but while she walked away Rex informed her that Maul had escaped his imprisonment, but Tano, having let him out herself, informed Rex upon this fact, to his surprise.

Continuing on, Rex told her that the Star Destroyer was going down and that all of the clones aboard were willing to die in order to kill them both. With that, Tano walked over to Rex and removed his helmet, revealing his distraught state. With this, Tano explained that Rex was a good soldier, but that every one of the clones trying to kill was too.

She then knelt down and asked the droids if she could count on them to which all three of them agreed that she could. With their acknowledgement, she stood up and informed her four allies that she would explain her plan on the way to the hangar. As they approached the hangar, Tano explained that Rex would feign her capture to the clones as a distraction, while the droids snuck past them and activated the lifts beneath clones' feet.

As the clones continued to aim their blasters upon Tano, Rex explained that the order had been to eliminate the Jedi for treason and that since Tano was no longer a Jedi, she should not be considered a traitor under the directive. This caused Jesse to briefly pause before he informed Rex that he himself had informed the clones that they were under special orders from Darth Sidious to eliminate Tano, even though she was no longer considered a Jedi, as well as any clone who disobeyed the directive.

As Rex and Tano continued to fight the remaining clones, Maul ran past them, and, noticing Maul running past them thanks to G-G, Tano notified Rex. Finding the remaining clones insignificant, Tano chased after Maul and allowed Rex to deal with the rest of them as he followed her. As she arrived to stop Maul, he threw several crates at her with the Force, telling her that she had wanted this chaos and threw a cart at her as she jumped to avoid it. Finally arriving to attack Maul, Tano slashed at Maul before he used the Force in a powerful push, knocking her all the way back to the lifts; however, before she could fall into the starship bay below, G-G managed to use one of his cables to help her back up.

However, reinforcements began to arrive in the hangar, which Rex noted to Tano, who was still attempting to hold Maul back. Being forced to divert his attention, Rex was forced to let go and defend her from the oncoming clones. Tano continued to strain and witnessed as R7 was killed by one of the clones' stray blaster bolts.

              " 'On her third day on Raada, Tano took the opportunity to explore the hills and caves ringing the settlement. She found a cave which she identified as her hiding place. Tano later met with Kaeden, her sister Miara Larte and several local friends including the farmer Tibbola, the work crew leader Vartan, and the twins Hoban and Neera at Selda\\'s cantina, which had the best food in the settlement. The cantina was owned by the Togruta bartender Selda and run by the Sullustan woman Malat, who reminded Tano of Jedi Master Plo Koon. While socializing with her hosts, Tano learned that Kaeden and Miara were orphans who had lost their parents in an accident. Vartan had adopted the two girls. When Kaeden asked \"Ashla\" about her family, Tano claimed that she was adopted. When Selda asked Tano if she was part of the influx of aliens that had migrated out of the Core Worlds, Tano claimed that she was not running from anything but only longed for quiet. Selda advised her to talk to him or Vartan if she encountered any changes.\\n',\n",
              " 'As time passed, Tano became the settlement\\'s mechanic and repaired numerous broken threshers and other farming equipment. Kaeden and Miara came to regard \"Ashla\" as an adopted family member and regularly visited Tano to chat and deliver gifts including a door lock. Despite the friendship of the Larte sisters, Tano decided that she had grown bored with her new rustic, backwater adopted home. One free day, she packed up some supplies and went to meditate in the caves alone. Tano sensed a disturbance in the Force and witnessed the arrival of an Imperial Star Destroyer above the settlement. The Imperial official Jenneth Pilar had decided to exploit Raada as a source of crops for the Imperial Military. Despite initially panicking, Tano decided that the Empire had not come to hunt her.\\n',\n",
              " \"Tano traveled to Selda's cantina and discussed the arrival of the Empire with Kaeden and her friends. Miara speculated that the Empire had come to explore the possibility of growing crops on Raada. The arrival of Imperial rule saw the introduction of new restrictive measures including night curfews, rules forbidding large group meetings, and restricting cantinas' operating hours, food, and alcohol. In response, Tano advised her friends to start stockpiling rations. While several Imperial personnel visited the cantina, Tano and her friends avoided contact with the Imperials by playing a game of crokin. When they inquired about Ahsoka's knowledge regarding their new situation, Tano decided not to reveal her past yet.\\n\",\n",
              " 'The following morning, Tano was visited by a pair of stormtroopers who asked why she was working. Tano informed them that her job was fixing broken machines, and so one of them asked for her information, saying that she may be reassigned to field if they deem it necessary. Wishing to maintain the freedom she had under her job repairing machines, Tano used a mind trick to convince the stormtroopers that her work was important for food production and they did not need to reassign her. With the pair in agreement with her, she asked if there was anything else she could help with and one reminded her of the new rules posted around the settlement. Tano closed the door on them and accumulated her rations to take to the caves. Being cautious of any surveillance that could be watching her, she made her way to the caves and hid the rations.\\n',\n",
              " 'Wishing to move her freighter from the spaceport before the Empire locked it down, Tano scouted a place to hide it, discovering a gully where the starship could fit. She then headed to the spaceport to retrieve the freighter. There, an Imperial officer took list of the starships in the port. He asked Tano of her purpose there, to which she told him that she wished to move her ship. The officer tried to assure her that the local garrison would keep it safe, but she then began mocking the security, making her way past the haggled officer before he could continue to dispute.\\n',\n",
              " \"Tano proceeded to the pilot's seat of the freighter and prepared for takeoff. The Imperial officer reattempted to argue but was muffled out by the engines as she flew the ship away. Tano flew her freighter the opposite way to the gully, taking it the long way around Raada to cover her tracks. Although she briefly considered abandoning the moon forever to run from the Empire, she chose to continue instead and hid her ship in the gully with its nose positioned upwards towards the sky to ensure a swift take off.\\n\",\n",
              " \"Later, Tano met up with Kaeden, Miara, and number of other farmers at Selda's cantina. Neera informed Tano that Malat and her husband had already found work on the planet Sullust. Tano lied that her freighter had been stolen when Kaeden asked why she had not also decided to leave Raada. She and Miara then discussed the capabilities of the security lock the latter had created for her, with Vartan asking about making bigger charges. As Tano shut this down, Hoban argued that explosives would get rid of the Empire, to which the Togruta claimed would provoke reinforcements from the Empire, insisting that surviving with the Empire was a better strategy.\\n\",\n",
              " \"Tano then learned from Kaeden and Miara that the overseers were adding two hours to the farmers' shifts, with the Empire was planning on speeding up the crops and bringing their own seeds in. In this time, a number of uniformed Imperials entered the cantina. Tano then tabled the idea that the Empire was going to buy off the overseers and overwork the farmers, brushing off Neera's inquiry into her past. Hoban insisted in blowing up Imperials, but as Tano began arguing with him, a drunken Tibbola got into a scuffle with an Imperial officer. The Imperial officer overpowered Tibbola and let a stormtrooper shoot the farmer dead.\\n\",\n",
              " \"After Vartan, Hoban and Neera left, Tano watched Kaeden play crokin and suggested that the safest way to hurt the Empire on Raada was for the farmers to begin working slower to slow the growth of their crops. Before Kaeden and Miara departed, Tano told them to relay the suggestion to Vartan, who presumably knew how to slow crop growth. Tano briefly spoke to Selda, who deduced that she had seen deaths like Tibbola's before and told her to be careful. The bartender then gave her some leftover food. Tano quickly walked home after.\\n\",\n",
              " \"For the next two weeks, Tano spent her days smuggling food, medical supplies, and water recyclers out to the caves. Tano was aided by the bartender Selda and several local vendors. In response to the slow growth of crops, thanks to the farmers, the new Imperial overseers extended the farmers' work shifts without increasing food rations, water, and breaks. Vartan discovered that the Empire was growing a new artificial crop on Raada that leached the planet's soils, preventing the farms from growing more crops. This fueled local resentment against the Empire since Raada had little arable land.\\n\",\n",
              " \"In a conversation about the artificial crops, Tano convinced Vartan to lend her Miara and Kaeden, whom she recruited for assembling bombs that were to be used to attack Imperial forces. Tano showed Kaeden her caves on a map and later handed the farmer and Miara food at those same caves. The sisters became questioned Tano's intentions in stockpiling at the caves so early on, but Tano dismissed it as habits and directed the conversation towards Kaeden and Miara's parents. Over the next several days, Vartan recruited forty farmers including Hoban into a resistance movement for Tano. He briefed the Togruta on the matter at Selda's cantina, displaying how the recruits were organized into crews. Before leaving, Tano told him that she would brief the farmers the next day and departed the cantina.\\n\",\n",
              " 'Later, Tano led a mission to plant the corrosive charges on the Imperial walkers stored at the Raadian shipyard. For the mission she chose Miara, Neera and the Rodian Kolvin to accompany her; Miara to help set the charges, Neera for her swift thinking, and Kolvin for his nimbleness. Due to the weak stormtrooper security, Tano and her team infiltrated the spaceport easily. While planting charges, Tano took her time to observe the patrols, feeling that they would not be able to infiltrate the compound as easily after. After observing a couple patrol cycles passed, Neera advised the Togruta that it was time to leave.\\n',\n",
              " 'Tano branched from the group with Miara to continue setting charges, and the Togruta was reminded of her time on Onderon during the Clone Wars. During their work, she also discovered that Miara had smuggled a real bomb, asking the girl of it. Miara tried to dismiss this as an accident, but the Togruta pressed her inquiry, asking if her companion had been plotting behind her back. The pair were briefly interrupted when another patrol passed, this time scanning the compound for a moment. After they passed, Tano and Miara continued their mission and soon reunited with Neera and Kolvin.\\n',\n",
              " \"After evading stormtrooper sentries, Tano and her team headed back to Selda's cantina. There, she discovered that Vartan had sent Hoban and Kaeden on an unsanctioned mission to attack the Imperial admin building. Since the uprising was premature, Tano urged the farmers to return home and to disavow any knowledge of what had happened that night to evade any arresting that could ensue. However, Miara refused to abandon her older sister. A reluctant Tano agreed to rescue Kaeden and the others but warned Miara to follow her orders and bring the explosives.\\n\",\n",
              " 'Tano ran through the streets with Miara and Neera towards the Imperial admin building when the alarms sounded from the Imperial compound, where the damage to the walkers had been discovered. As they continued to the compound, an explosion sounded and Miara denied that it was one of her bombs. When Tano told her two comrades to reveal the real plan, Neera revealed that Hoban had split the resistance fighters into three groups and that they were armed with explosives and blasters.\\n',\n",
              " 'Tano ordered Miara to hide in the caves and Neera to bring the remaining resistance fighters to the caves. Tano decided to disable the Imperial tanks. When Miara asked \"Ashla\" what she was going to do, Tano responded that she would head to the thickest part of the fighting and evacuate as many people as she could. Tano also confided that she was a veteran of the Clone Wars when Miara asked again where she had come from. After separating from Miara, Tano and Neera headed to the Imperial compound, where Hoban\\'s ill-equipped fighters had been repelled by the garrison\\'s heavy artillery and the five remaining survivors including Hoban and Kaeden were pinned down by enemy fire.\\n',\n",

Tano then took the opportunity to lead the five survivors to safety, knocking a stormtrooper to the ground and stealing the soldier's blaster. While fleeing the fighting, Tano and the farmers were blocked by a row of stormtroopers. Hoban surrendered but was gunned down by the troopers. Before these stormtroopers could execute the remaining survivors, though, Tano used the Force to fling the stormtroopers' blasters to the ground. Tano and the Raadian farmers then fled to the caves, with the former using the force to deflect artillery.\\n\",\n",

With Neera being sedated to prevent her from harming herself, the farmers took some time to be quiet before Tano decided to reveal her identity as a former Jedi apprentice. Kaeden was angry with Tano for not revealing her Jedi identity since she could have saved Hoban's life and stormed off before the Togruta could continue explaining herself. Having been discovered by the Empire, Tano considered leaving to avoid drawing further attention from the Empire. While meditating, Tano was interrupted by Miara, who informed her that her sister Kaeden had left the caves and headed back to town.

Tano, though, managed to infiltrate the Imperial admin building to retrieve Kaeden from her cell. Using one of Miara's corrosive explosives, the Togruta infiltrated the cell and carried the drugged farmer out of the high window using the Force, who told Tano that the Imperials wanted her very badly in a moment of consciousness. After escaping to the outskirts, Kaeden told Tano that the Imperial commander had taken an interest in her and advised her to leave offworld, thanking the Jedi for helping them.

After retrieving R2-D2, Organa hired the pilots Chardri Tage and Tamsin to find Tano and then contact him to arrange a rendezvous.

Upon landing in the Fardi shipyard, Tano was greeted by the Fardi patriarch who told her that she was always welcome to work as a mechanic for his family. The Fardi patriarch also told Tano that his daughters missed her and invited her for dinner. Tano was greeted by the now five-year old Hedala, who confided that she had sensed a \"shadow\" while Tano was away. Before the togruta could ask about this, though, the Fardi cousins gathered around her, expressing their joy of her safety.

Hedala also mentioned that the \"shadow\" had one day mysteriously disappeared. Tano believed that this individual was a dark side creature, recalling rumors of a dark lord that served the Emperor. This \"shadow\" was actually the Sixth Brother, who had been hunting Hedala before redeploying to Raada. Tano complimented Hedala for staying out of the \"shadow\"\\'s way and told her not to mention the individual to her sisters.

While on a routine flight, she picked up a distress call from an escape pod. After rescuing the occupants of the pod, Tano was informed that their shuttle had been attacked by pirates, who had taken several hostages. The occupants, all humans, were part of a company that had been targeted by a rival firm competing for a large project.

Tano also commented that the lack of communications had caused deaths on Raada and also rooted her hostile response to Tage and Tamsin. After some discussion, Tano convinced Organa to let her run his intelligence networks and to provide her with a new ship. At Organa's suggestion, Tano adopted the code name Fulcrum for her work as a rebel spy, allowing her to network with rebels across the galaxy, including an Anx informant located on the planet Garel..

She spoke only with Hera Syndulla, the owner and pilot of the Ghost, and identified herself only by her codename. As Fulcrum, Tano provided the Spectres with intelligence for missions in order to hit Imperial forces or interests, and those missions were part of a larger plan that the rebels were part of—one that, amongst the rebels, only Syndulla knew. Tano\\'s intelligence was generally accurate, but sometimes only partially so. One mission that Syndulla, along with Ezra Bridger and Sabine Wren—the daughter of Ursa Wren, whom Tano had encountered during the Clone Wars—went on was an attack on an Imperial convoy. The intelligence that Fulcrum provided was correct about the route and timing of the convoy, but underestimated the Imperial defenses. As a result, the Phantom—the shuttle used by the rebels—sustained minor damage while outrunning a squadron of TIE fighters. Tano wrote a report to General Davits Draven about the Spectres, praising them for their efforts in freeing Wookiee prisoners, destroying a Star Destroyer, and disrupting Imperial shipping lanes between Lothal and Garel.

Wren, eager to know more about the individual giving them their intelligence, suggested that \"Fulcrum\" wait for them at the rendezvous, prompting Tano to wonder if something was wrong. Syndulla convinced Tano, however, that Wren was just there to help with the mission.

Tano used the Force to block the Emperor's fiery energy, but as she struggled to maintain the barrier, Ezra helped her before the pair fled. When Ezra was snared by a tendril of energy, Tano used her lightsabers to free him. As they kept running, they were separated, but promised to meet each other once again in the future. As Bridger headed back to the portal from where he arrived, Tano made her way into another portal, which brought her back to Malachor, near the base of the Sith temple, accompanied by her convor friend Morai. She wished the Force to be with Ezra Bridger and headed down into a dark tunnel with Morai.\\n\",\n",
              " 'Upon her entrance into the dark tunnel, Tano came across a flight of steps which took her deeper into the tunnel, eventually finding a stream and Morai waiting for her. She then entered the stream and followed Morai to another flight of steps that eventually led her to another portal into the World Between Worlds. With this, she stepped inside of it, returning to the mystical plane. Ahsoka Tano thus embarked on a spiritual journey that changed the course of her life. Morai, meanwhile, left the temple and was seen by Vader as he trekked across the surface of Malachor. Vader assumed Tano to have died. With her supposed death, the Great Jedi Purge came to an end.\\n',\n",

Five years after her encounter with Ezra Bridger in the World Between Worlds and the Liberation of Lothal, during which Bridger, as a sacrifice to protect those he loved, went missing by taking himself, Imperial Grand Admiral Thrawn, and the Chimaera away into hyperspace via a pod of purrgil, Tano and Wren began a search for Ezra. Their mission entailed a venture into the Unknown Regions. Tano had also reunited with Huyang, who joined both aboard T-6 One-Nine-Seven-Four.\\n',\n",

However, the two would ultimately part ways in on bad terms, with Wren later alledging that Tano had given up on her training. Tano, meanwhile, believed Wren was not ready to begin the path of a Jedi. Wren returned to Lothal while Tano continued to live out of her T-6.\\n',\n",
              " 'In 9 ABY, some years after she had last seen Wren, Tano had begun searching for Thrawn and followed a lead to the forested planet Corvus, looking for information on the location of the Grand Admiral as part of the search for Ezra Bridger. In order to obtain this information, Tano ventured to the city of Calodan, which was ruled by Magistrate Morgan Elsbeth, a servant and former apprentice of Thrawn, and her army. Bo-Katan Kryze knew of her journey to Corvus and directed the Mandalorian Din Djarin to her location in order for him to complete his quest to bring an infant of the same species as Yoda to the Jedi.\\n',\n",
              " \"While making her way to Calodan, Tano met great resistance and was attacked by a legion of Elsbeth's scout guards. Tano managed to overpower them and force them to retreat. As they retreated, Tano used her white lightsabers to cut down one of the guards as they retreated further towards the city gates of Calodan. Turning off her lightsabers and using the fog-filled forest to her advantage, Tano hid behind a tree and used the Force to distract the guards before reigniting her lightsabers and cutting through another one of them by slashing through a tree. In retaliation, the guards once again began firing at her with their A350 blaster rifles, leading Tano to use the Force to throw a piece of the tree she had just cut down at one of the guards, before turning off her lightsabers again, disappearing into the mist. Tano briefly emerged and cut down another guard using her lightsabers before disappearing once more as guards continued to shoot at her.\\n\",\n",
              " \"Sneaking behind of the guards, she cut them in half, leaving one guard remaining. As the last remaining guard attempted to retreat back to the city, Tano emerged from the mist and blocked the final guards' blaster bolts before cutting the guard down. As Tano returned to the mist, Elsbeth, from atop a sentry point on the walls surrounding Calodan, requested that Tano show herself, to which Tano obliged, lightsabers once again ignited. Elsbeth announced that she had been expecting Tano, to which she replied that she must then know what she was after. Elsbeth declared that she will learn nothing from her, but Tano bluntly stated that she will not give Elsbeth that choice.\\n\",\n",
              " \"Calling up one of her HK-87 assassin droids, Elsbeth presented one of the town's inhabitants, now Elsbeth's captive, and asked how many lives Tano was willing to sacrifice to gain the information she sought. Elsbeth went on to note that the lives of the city's inhabitants meant little to her and that the people in the city would suffer because of Tano's interference. However, Tano declared that the people were already suffering under Elsbeth's rule and that Elsbeth should surrender if she did not want to face the consequences of her crimes. Raising one of her lightsabers, Tano announced that she would give Elsbeth one day to make her decision as Elsbeth disdainfully smirked at her. Extinguishing her lightsabers, Tano retreated back into the mist and away from Elsbeth.\\n\",\n",
              " \"By daybreak, Tano had retreated deep into the forest. Eventually, Tano discovered the Mandalorian Din Djarin who had been searching across the landscape for her. Seeing him as a threat, Tano lunged at him using her lightsabers; however, Djarin heard her and managed to block her lightsabers using his wrist gauntlets. As she continued to strike, Djarin managed to block each of her slashes by continuing to use his wrist gauntlets before using his flamethrower to stagger her and his wipcord launcher to immobilize her. Seeing a branch above her, Tano leapt over it, freeing her and, as the whipcord was still attached to Djarin's wrist gauntlet, dragging Djarin up with her before the whipcord snapped. Now free, Tano reignited her sabers, prepared to continue the fight before Djarin called out her name and declared that Bo-Katan had sent him, requesting to speak with the former Jedi. Noticing Djarin's foundling, a youngling of the same species as Yoda, sitting atop a rock, Tano moved out of her fighting stance and noted to Djarin that she hoped they would be talking about him.\\n\",\n",
              " \"By nightfall, she and the youngling were telepathically communicating through the Force under the light of a lantern and a moon above. Standing up, Tano picked up the youngling, who, as she had discovered through their telepathic communication, was named Grogu and raised in the Jedi Temple. Tano brought Grogu and the lantern closer to Djarin and sat down next to the youngling. Djarin asked if Grogu was speaking to her and if she understood him. To this, Tano answered that she and Grogu could feel each other's thoughts. Djarin was shocked at learning Grogu's name for the first time and questioned the name upon hearing it. Tano reaffirmed that his name was Grogu and explained to Djarin that Grogu had been raised in the Jedi Temple on Coruscant and that he had been trained by many masters over his many years. However, she went on to explain that he had been hidden away by someone at the temple at the end of the Clone Wars when the Galactic Republic was reorganized into the Galactic Empire, but, after that, his memory became clouded and he did not remember much of the years following. Continuing on, Tano explained that Grogu had felt lost and alone after the Jedi Order's collapse.\\n\",\n",
              " \"Moving on from Grogu's origins, Tano explained that she had known another member of his species, Jedi Grand Master Yoda, and noted how wise he had been. Tano asked Djarin if Grogu could still wield the Force as he had done at the Jedi Temple, to which Djarin questioned if she was referring to his powers. Tano explained that the Force is what gives Grogu his powers and that the Force was an energy field created by all living things. With this, she explained that one would need to have a great deal of discipline and training in the Force such powers. Now knowing this, Djarin brought up the supposedly unexplainable things Grogu had done prior and how he had been tasked to bring Grogu to a Jedi. However, to this, Tano simply explained that the Jedi Order had fallen long ago, to which Djarin noted that even though the Empire was gone, it still hunted Grogu and that he would need her help if he was to evade them longer. With that, Tano recommended that they let Grogu sleep and that she would test his abilities in the morning.\\n\",\n",
              " \"At daybreak, Tano, Djarin, and Grogu ventured to a clearing and, when they arrived, Tano walked up to Grogu and playfully stated that they would find out what knowledge Grogu possessed. With that, Tano motioned Djarin to place Grogu down on one of the rocks, which he complied with. Grabbing a small stone, Tano used the Force to slowly levitate the stone into Grogu's hands and explained that she wished for him to return the stone to her outstretched hand. Before giving him a chance to do anything, Djarin interjected and attempted to inform Tano that Grogu didn't understand, but Tano rejected his inquiry, simply stating that Grogu could understand what she was asking of him.\\n\",\n",
              " 'Arm still outstretched, she told Grogu that it was ok and once again requested the stone from Grogu. However, instead of returning the stone to her using the Force, Grogu simply dropped it, leading her to lower her arm in disappointment and walk towards him. Grabbing one of his small hands, Tano used the Force to feel his emotions and calmly announced that she felt great fear in Grogu and, as she stood up and walked back to her original position, she explained to Djarin that Grogu had hidden his abilities over the years in order to conceal himself.\\n',\n",
              " \"Tano then announced that she wished to try something else and asked Djarin to come over to her. Djarin misunderstood and signaled for Grogu to go to Tano instead and when he didn't move, he exclaimed that Grogu was stubborn. However, Tano quickly stopped him and informed him that she was not the one who would be performing the test but Djarin himself, explaining that she wanted to see if he would listen to him. This prompted Djarin to begin complaining about how, if Grogu would listen to him, it would be one of the first times, to which Tano jokingly told Djarin that she liked firsts, whether they be good or bad because of how memorable they were. Handing the stone to Djarin, Tano instructed him to hold the stone in the palm of his hand and to request for Grogu to lift the stone using the Force.\\n\",\n",
              " 'As Tano walked past Djarin to witness the test, Tano whispered into his ear a request for him to use Grogu\\'s name as opposed to referring to him as \"kid\" as he had done when first requesting for him to take the stone. Walking away and leaning on a large boulder, Tano watched as Djarin requested for Grogu to take the stone once more and him giving up moments later, once again claiming Grogu was stubborn. To this, Tano instructed Djarin to try to connect with Grogu prompting Djarin to pull out a small, silver ball used on one of the levers on his gunship, the Razor Crest, which Grogu had become quite fond of. Kneeling down, Djarin asked if Grogu wanted the ball and requested for him to take it. With little hesitation, Grogu used the Force to pull the ball to him.\\n',\n",
              " \"Djarin congratulated Grogu on this, and, while doing so, Tano noted the attachment Grogu had formed with him and that she could not train him. Djarin was shocked by this and asked why she could not, citing his abilities. To this, Tano explained that his attachment to Djarin made him vulnerable to the dark side. Djarin, however, did not understand and insisted that this was even more of a reason to train Grogu, but Tano once again refused, indirectly citing her former master, Anakin Skywalker, and how his emotions had gotten the best of him, turning him to the dark side. She once again refused to allow Grogu to go down that path and said that it would be better if they just let Grogu's abilities with the Force fade as he grew older. Hurrying, Tano informed Djarin that she had waited too long and that she had to return to Calodan and save its inhabitants.\\n\",\n",
              " 'As Tano walked away, Djarin noted how Elsbeth had sent Djarin to kill her and that he had not agreed to anything of what Tano had just told him. Attempting to strike a deal, Djarin told Tano that he would assist Tano in saving Calodan if she assisted him in training Grogu. Agreeing to this, Tano and Djarin set off on their journey back to Calodan.\\n',\n",
              " \"On their way back to Calodan, Djarin noted the forces Elsbeth had under her control, including the HK-87 assassin droids, scout guards, and her hired gunfighter, Lang, and mentioned how he believed that her lightsabers would not be able to protect her from the amount of blaster bolts that would be shot at her. In response, Tano affirmed his remark and that he should also be wary of the magistrate herself. Upon Djarin's questioning of who Elsbeth, Tano revealed her name to Djarin and that her home had been ravaged during the Clone Wars with her people massacred. Continuing on, she further explained that this developed a great anger in her, which led to her helping construct warships for the Imperial Navy and ravage worlds herself. This led Djarin to note the burned forest that surrounded them. After quickly surveying the environment, Tano asked Djarin if he had seen any prisoners within the city's walls, leading him to note the three villagers that had been taken prisoner. Tano declared that they had to find a way to free them, to which Djarin noted that Elsbeth's army would never see the pairing of the two coming.\\n\",\n",
              " \"At late dusk, the two finally completed their journey. Running at the city's entrance, Tano used the Force to leap up to the sentry point at the city's gate, igniting one of her lightsabers and kicking one of the scout guards. Blocking the blaster bolts fired at her by another scout guard, Tano grabbed the guard and flung them against a support beam of a gong, the city's alarm system, before promptly blocking the blaster bolts of another scout guard. She then threw the body of the scout guard she had grabbed prior and tossing him into the wall opposite of where he had been prior. Immediately afterwards, she used the Force to grab the A350 blaster rifle out of the hands of one of the scout guards and threw it at the scout guard firing their rifle behind her, knocking the guard out. The guard she had grabbed the blaster from then raised his hands in surrender and escaped from Tano. Dodging the strike of a heavy weapon, she then sliced a sentry guard in half, slicing the gong in half in the process.\\n\",\n",
              " \"As Elsbeth's forces took formation outside of the city's main building, Tano emerged from around one of the city's huts and began to slowly walk towards Elsbeth's army. Slowing to a halt, she tossed the shoulder plate of Djarin's armor for Elsbeth and her army to see, claiming that Djarin had failed to kill her and once again asked for Elsbeth to give her what she sought. Instead, Elsbeth ordered her guards to attack Tano, forcing her to leap up to the roof of one of the huts and block the oncoming blaster bolts with her lightsabers. Being forced to retreat, Tano leapt behind the huts and out of sight of Elsbeth's army.\\n\",\n",
              " \"Leaping down behind two guards, Tano quickly used her lightsabers to eliminate them before disappearing once more. Emerging behind another two scout guards, Tano slowly revealed her lightsabers and dispatched the guards. Appearing upon a rooftop and igniting her lightsabers, she jumped down to face Elsbeth's hired gunfighter. Quickly disarming Lang, Tano stood triumphant for a moment, but was soon forced to divert her attention away when Elsbeth's two HK-87 assassin droids revealed themselves from opposite corners. Reacting quickly, Tano rushed up to one and slashing them in half before retreating and disappearing around another corner.\\n\",\n",
              " \"Standing atop one of the walls outside of the main building, Tano witnessed a faceoff between Djarin, who had snuck into the city during the chaos, and Lang before jumping down to face Elsbeth within her garden. Signaling a fight was about to take place, Tano and Elsbeth both took off their robes and readied their weapons, standing only a few meters away from one another. Using a spear made of pure beskar, Elsbeth lunged at Tano who quickly blocked her spear with one of her lightsabers before blocking a second strike with the same blade. Having not moved any closer to one another, Tano and Elsbeth began to pace perpendicular to one another, looking for an opening in each other's defenses. With Elsbeth lunging at her, Tano blocked another one of Elsbeth's strikes, now with both lightsabers as the two exchanged several more blows as the fight intensified. Starting to go on the offensive, Tano executed several strikes against Elsbeth's beskar spear before having to dodge two of Elsbeth's oncoming strikes. Switching positions, Tano went back on the offensive as Elsbeth blocked a strike from both of her lightsabers and entering into a saber lock that resulted in Elsbeth being pushed back by Tano's brute strength.\\n\",\n",
              " \"With Elsbeth having launched a strike at her throat, Tano was forced to dodge as Elsbeth quickly began aiming for her legs causing Tano to slowly walk backwards, blocking each one of her strikes before Elsbeth swept for her legs, forcing Tano to perform a front flip. Going back on the offensive, Elsbeth and Tano entered into a brief saber lock before Tano executed a strike at Elsbeth, leading her to duck below Tano's oncoming strike. Staggered for a brief moment, Elsbeth managed to knock one of Tano's blades out of her hand and into a small body of water nearby. Now armed with only her shoto lightsaber, Tano slowly backed up before putting her single remaining blade into a reverse grip and attempted to regain her breath as she slowly pushed Elsbeth back. As Tano launched several heavy strikes, Elsbeth continued to parry them before unsuccessfully attempting to sweep Tano's leg, giving Tano the upper hand and allowing her to grab Elsbeth's weapon with her free hand and throw it to the ground. Putting her saber up to Elsbeth's throat, Tano asked her one last time where her master, Grand Admiral Thrawn, was located.\\n\",\n",
              " \"By the next day, Djarin and Tano, spear in hand, walked outside of the city's gates as the citizens of Calodan celebrated their liberation from Elsbeth's rule. Presenting the spear to Djarin, Tano stated that she believed Elsbeth's spear had been payment for Tano's defeat. However, Djarin refused the offer, citing how he hadn't completed the task, which Tano affirmed, but stated that she believed a Mandalorian should possess the spear. As Djarin took the weapon, Tano asked where Grogu was, to which Djarin revealed that he was on the ship and that he would retrieve the infant. As Djarin walked away, Tano gave a troubled look before she was joined by Governor Wing who she gesturing to head back into the city along with her as a gesture of friendship. The two then proudly walked back inside the city's walls.\\n\",\n",
              " \"Later, Tano was present outside Djarin's gunship, the Razor Crest as Djarin was exiting with Grogu in hand to give to her to train. As he stepped outside, Tano stated that Grogu now saw Djarin as his father and once again stated that she could not train the youngling. Djarin was shocked by this, stating that he had held up his end of their bargain as Tano walked closer to him and took hold of Grogu's left hand. As she reached the two, Tano directed Djarin to the planet Tython where she recommended that he place Grogu on the seeing stone at the top of a mountain containing the ruins of an ancient temple with a strong connection to the Force. Djarin then questioned what he was supposed to do from there, to which Tano answered that Grogu would then be able to choose his own path and that if Grogu used the Force to reach out, a Jedi might be able to sense it and come to the planet searching for Grogu. However, she also stated that there were few remaining Jedi, which could possibly present a problem for the two. Djarin then thanked Tano and she wished for the Force to be with the two before smiling and bowing her head for Grogu, watching as the pair left in their gunship. With this, Tano began walking back towards Calodan, smiling.\\n\",\n",
              " 'Following the rescue of Grogu, Tano met the son of her former master Anakin, Luke Skywalker, who was also the current owner of her friend R2-D2. Shortly before the Battle of Mos Espa, Tano joined Skywalker and Grogu on the planet Ossus, where Skywalker was building a new Jedi temple to train a new generation of Jedi. She observed that Grogu missed his former warden Djarin a great deal, which she believed could complicate his Jedi training. During her time on Ossus, Djarin himself visited the temple with the intention of reuniting with Grogu and gifting him Mandalorian chain mail. The Mandalorian bounty hunter was ignored for sometime until R2-D2 led Tano to him to deal with his desire to see Grogu. While Djarin was surprised to see Tano on Ossus, she took the time to explain how the building would become \"a great school,\" with Grogu its first student, and promised the youngling was doing fine. When Djarin insisted on seeing him, Tano invited Djarin to accompany her on a walk through the bamboo forest and reminded him of her warning about how his attachment to Grogu would be difficult to let go off.\\n',\n",
              " \"Just as she respected Skywalker's decision to train Grogu, Tano agreed to respect Djarin's wish to see the child he had kept in his care for so long, motioning to a hill where Skywalker was seated with Grogu. She did, however, ask him to consider if he was doing it for Grogu or just himself, pondering if the armor was a way for the former foundling—who was possibly a Padawan by that point, by Tano's reckoning—to remember his father figure. While Djarin declared that the armor would protect Grogu no matter what path he chose, Tano offered to deliver it in his stead, believing that a reunion between Djarin and Grogu would only make his training more difficult. Djarin acquiesced to Ahsoka's offer and handed her the beskar armor, asking her to ensure Grogu would be protected.\\n\",\n",
              " \"Tano then joined Luke in watching one of Grogu's training exercises. She was impressed with both the child's progress and Skywalker's teaching skills. Skywalker replied that it was more like Grogu was remembering his previous lessons, to which Tano observed the student sometimes guided their master. Skywalker then revealed he knew the Mandalorian had been present, to which she revealed the gift he had dropped off. When Skywalker wondered whether Grogu was committed to being a Jedi, Tano told Luke he was just like his father and counseled him to trust his instincts. Tano then moved to leave to resume her search for Thrawn, promising Skywalker there was a chance they would meet again and bidding the Force be with him. In the end, Grogu would decide to return to Djarin and take on the life of a Mandalorian. At one point, Tano traveled to Black Spire Outpost on the world of Batuu, a city Thrawn and her master Anakin Skywalker had visited in the past.\\n\",\n",
              " \"At some point in that same year, Tano had begun hearing whispers surrounding the return of Grand Admiral Thrawn as heir to the Empire. Concerned about the idea, Tano interrogated Thrawn's ally Morgan Elsbeth for any information regarding Thrawn, his intentions, and how to find him. Elsbeth ended up revealing the location of a map to the alleged location of Thrawn, in the galaxy of Peridea.\\n\",\n",
              " 'Tano soon begun searching the ruins of an ancient stronghold on Arcana. She soon approached a runic circle in the middle of the stony courtyard and used her twin lightsabers to cut a hole below her feet, allowing her to access to the chamber underneath. Tano gazed at several cloaked figures carved onto the wall, before walking over to a pillar, and using Psychometry on it. Sensing that it was the key to retrieving the map, the former Jedi rotated a part of it, before then rotating the tip of it, which caused an orb next to one of the carvings to glow. Tano smirked, before moving over to a second pillar. After rotating a part of the second pillar, she watched an orb in the heart of one of the other carved figures to glow. She then rotated a part of a third pillar, causing a third orb to glow, and an altar with a rectangular stony object to rise from the floor. Tano touched the stony box, which had crumbled and revealed a golden orb. She had informed Professor Huyang that she had found the object via comlink, but his transmissions had been jammed.\\n',\n",
              " 'Tano soon returned to the surface where she was confronted by a red HK assassin droid, who had demanded the map. She had found herself surrounded by five assassin droids wielding electrostaffs. Tano had drawn her twin lightsabers in defense. Tano had jumped back into the hole she had created and had used her lightsaber to cut holes between three of the droids. Tano then fought the other two and had cut across the torso with her lightsaber. She had beheaded the fifth droid. As two droids had emerged from their holes, the lead droid had issued orders to initiate their self-destruct protocols. The other two droids had complied, and Tano had been forced to flee. While running, she had contacted Huyang, who had told her that their T-6 Jedi shuttle was above her position. She had told him to drop his ramp at a distance outside the ruins. The two had escaped before they could be killed by the fiery inferno that had swept through the ruins.\\n',\n",

He had told her that he had kept her ship at a safe distance in accordance with Jedi mission protocol. She had replied that the Jedi Order didn't exist anymore. When Huyang had said he had his programming, she had advised him to stick close and watch her back. Huyang had replied that it was the job of a Jedi Padawan learner, which he was not. Tano had told Huyang that he had found the map based on Elsbeth's information. When Huyang had asked how she had gotten Elsbeth to tell the truth, Tano had replied that she hadn't been following Jedi protocol.\\n\",\n",

Tano and Huyang then traveled to Home One via hyperspace. Tano identified their ship as T-6 1974, and Fleet Command cleared them to land at hangar 2-9. Inside the hangar, General Hera Syndulla greeted them and informed them about the loss of Elsbeth.\\n',\n",

In the briefing, Syndulla told Tano and Huyang about the damage the two mercenaries had done, taking out an entire security detail and scuttling a new starship. Tano was unfamiliar with the attackers, who had demonstrated Force powers similar to the Jedi. Huyang suggested that one of these intruders had once been a Jedi. Tano told Huyang to scan Skoll's and Shin’s lightsabers.\\n\",\n",

Tano also showed Syndulla the golden orb, explaining that Elsbeth had been interested in this map since she believed it would lead to the location of Thrawn, the last Imperial Grand Admiral. Syndulla was surprised that Thrawn had survived the Battle of Lothal, but Tano explained that she had heard whispers of his survival. Syndulla asked if this meant that Ezra Bridger was alive. Tano was uncertain but warned that their enemies were also searching.\\n\",\n",

Tano soon arrived on the planet, and parked her T-6 shuttle near a ledge on a high tower. Wren arrived while Tano was talking to Governor Azadi. When Azadi said that Wren had missed the ceremony yesterday, Wren replied that it had slipped her mind. Azadi said everyone had missed her, but Wren replied that not everyone had been there. Huyang also greeted Sabine, who recognized him. Huyang said he still had 75 percent original parts before returning to the ship. Azadi told Wren to listen to what Tano had to say before leaving.

When Wren asked if she was certain Bridger was still out there, Tano responded that whilst nothing was certain, their enemy was seeking Thrawn, which was what had led her to the map. Tano explained she had found the map on the planet Arcana, a Nightsister stronghold thousands of years ago. Due to her skills as an artist, Tano sought Wren's help in deciphering the map. Wren believed there was a code. Tano shared a scan of the Nightsister temple chamber where they had found it. When questioned about where home was, Tano described her soul as a home. Both women blamed each other for not making it easy for each other. Tano replied that the Jedi way was hard.\\n\",\n",

Tano refused since she believed the map was not just about finding Bridger but preventing another war. She warned Wren that the map stayed aboard the ship before entering the lab to chat with Huyang. Huyang had scanned Skoll's and Hati's lightsabers. The droid said that he recognized one of the two hilts, which was built in the Jedi style. The one he knew belonged to Baylan Skoll, who had disappeared at the end of the Clone Wars. Huyang told Ahsoka that Skoll had been Jedi trained. Tano surmised that Hati was Skoll's apprentice.

Tano was worried about Wren, but Syndulla told her to give her some space. Syndulla believed that Wren was their best chance of reading the map. Tano admitted she had a difficult relationship with Wren, describing the Mandalorian as stubborn and bullish. Syndulla attributed these traits to her Mandalorian background and said that mentoring could be a challenge, suggesting that Anakin Skywalker may have found her difficult sometimes. Tano said that she had walked away from her Jedi training and admitted walking away from Wren.\\n\",\n",

Huyang soon interrupted, informing the pair that they had received communications from Wren, who was being hunted down by HK droids led by Shin Hati. Tano and Huyang soon piloted the ship, and flew towards Wrens tower. As Hati and Wren dueled, the former stabbed Wren through the abdomen, leaving her completely wounded. Upon seeing the ship arrive, Hati fled with the map, as Tano quickly tended to Wren who lay on the floor dying.

Weaver stated that he was particularly busy at the moment, but Syndulla pressed him, stating that this would be a far more formal investigation if she could not do so immediately. Weaver took them on a tram through the production plant, telling them the insides of his operation. During the ride, he was questioned on the loyalty of his workers  to which he replied that average workers did not care about galactic politics. After this, Hera suggested that Tano take Sabine back on as an apprentice. Tano replied that neither of them was ready for that.

While Weaver was explaining the priority given to shareholders, Hera spotted a massive hyperdrive core. Weaver explained that it had been extracted from a Super Star Destroyer. Hera was befuddled since the New Republic had not been constructing anything of that size. Weaver checked the logs and explained that it was of a classified nature and that it needed approval before he could unseal it. The supervisor asked for the protocol droid C1-D1 to explain the regulations surrounding it. Tano questioned him on the other types of droids in use, but the protocol droid interjected by stating that she had been interrupted by an HK earlier. The protocol droid stated that it was on the transport about to leave with the massive hyperspace core.

They dueled, with Ahsoka defeating the droid as Marrok received a transmission telling him to leave. He hurled his lightsaber as Ahsoka flipped over it, and ran to a shuttle picking him up. The shuttle opened fire on Ahsoka, who dodged everything, including Marrok's lightsaber which flew back to him.

Coordinating with Wren, Ahsoka flew towards the planet and dove at Sabine’s timing. This allowed Sabine to be able to get several shots off, missing them. She did redeem herself shortly and destroyed one craft. Now in the orbit of the planet, Sabine managed to destroy two more fighters. As this happened, they came into sight of the Eye of Sion. Huyang correctly guessed that it was a massive Hyperspace Ring. When they came into range, Elsbeth opened fire with turbolasers as the fighters pulled back. Huyang insisted on getting a scan.

As Sabine repaired the ship, Ahsoka climbed back in and ordered her to punch it. They fled down to the planet’s surface, evading the fighters behind a school of Purrgil in the clouds.

The markings on her montrals were unique. During her early childhood, her trust in others was negatively impacted by a Jedi imposter who tried to enslave her, and the memory of the scorn her fellow villagers felt towards her remained with her until her trip to Ilum; upon trusting Master Yoda, she felt that trust came easier to her because she was again trusting her own instincts. The teachings and values of the Jedi Order became sacred to her, and she always sought to protect the lives of innocents.\\n',\n",

The young Tano\\'s emotions made her a perfect apprentice for Anakin Skywalker, with Grand Master Yoda himself recognizing that the two became \"twice the trouble\" after being paired together. She was very feisty and snippy, earning her the nickname \"Snips\" from her master. Like her master, she could at times become aggressive and willing to use terror or threats to get the answers she wanted. She had a tendency to follow her heart, which negatively impacted her path to Jedi knighthood. In her younger years, Tano\\'s emotions inhibited her ability to make wise decisions, although she eventually gained the confidence to make the right ones, despite the great cost to her feelings. Beyond learning from both Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi, the teachings of Qui-Gon Jinn were indirectly passed down to Tano.\\n',\n",
              " 'Over time, Tano became more mature and enlightened, with her experiences during the Clone Wars shaping her into someone who could control her emotions. She had her victories, her failures, and her losses yet strove through them all, as she felt it was her duty as a Jedi to help restore peace and prosperity to the Republic. Her constant travels and experiences made her more worldly than most people her age, and often she was surprised by the various events and people she came across during the Clone Wars. Throughout her time as a Jedi, she remained close with Plo Koon, who had brought her to the Jedi Temple, and saw him as an important mentor in her life. She also developed a friendships with Obi-Wan Kenobi and his second-in-command, Cody, as well as Senator Amidala through her master, Anakin Skywalker.\\n',\n",

However, when Tano was framed for murder and treason, she was horrified when the Jedi Order cast her out and all but condemned her to a Republic military tribunal, and came very close to being sentenced to death. When Skywalker unveiled the true culprit, Tano was shocked to see it was her friend Barriss Offee. Though conflicted, she ultimately rejected the opportunity to become a Jedi again, having lost faith in the Order for not standing by her.\\n',\n",
              " 'Tano formed a strong bond with the clones, especially Captain Rex, and throughout her time as serving as their commander had learned a lot from them. She respected the clones as individuals and got along with them very well. Tano quickly began to enjoy their company, telling war stories with them as soon as she had any experience to speak on. When Tano found herself serving with the clones of the 501st again at the Siege of Mandalore, the clones continued to salute her out of respect and even repainted their helmets in her likeness to show how much she meant to them. When Order 66 turned the friends she had served with for years into enemies, Tano stood by her beliefs and told Rex to not kill them, determined to escape without directly killing her former comrades. When the ship crashed into the moon, Tano returned to the crash site to dig graves for each clone.\\n',\n",

This carried on even after she left the Order, as she joined Bail Organa's rebellion to restore liberty and democracy to the people oppressed by the Empire. Tano also felt pity and compassion for the Inquisitor known as the Sixth Brother despite slaying him in combat. She regarded the Sixth Brother as a victim whose potential for good had been twisted and turned to the dark side. After befriending the Force-sensitive Hedala Fardi, Tano became concerned with protecting Force-sensitive children from being captured by the Empire's Inquisitors. During her time with the Martez sisters shortly before the end of the war, they noted that she still acted like a Jedi even though she was no longer a member of the order.\\n\",\n",
              " 'During her time running from the Empire, Tano continued to suffer from grief over the loss of her friends and guilt over the fact that she wasn\\'t there to help them. During her time on Raada, Tano was unsure about making new friends, largely due to the emotional pain inflicted by Offee\\'s betrayal. Despite everything Offee had done, Tano believed that while she was wrong about \"a lot of things,\" she did have a point about the Jedi and the Republic, and later expressed her belief that if had they truly listened to her, they might have been able to stop Darth Sidious before it was too late. When Tano began to help people hurt by the Empire, she felt better about herself and as though she was fulfilling her training to do justice, feeling even better because her work was hurting the Empire that hurt her. She felt as though she had been a hero in her past and was one again, although she knew she needed to try to avoid tapping into her reckless nature. She decided to find a middle path to life when she became a rebel, not becoming a Jedi again but also not allowing her heart to harden when faced with the death of friends.\\n',\n",
              " \"In addition to knowing friends would die in war, she knew it could change people, having spent her life as a Padawan fighting as a soldier instead of working as a peace keeper. Thus, she came to hate warfare, with her distaste for it making her notice that the fourteen year old Miara Larte had altered her behavior to avoid the Empire's patrols. In fact, she believed that, just because she had started to fight in the Clone Wars at that age, it was not a good example for Larte. Even as Imperial forces closed in, she found that meditation was easy for her, yet she also recognized she had nothing to say to the Empire's troops on Raada, not even using banter or taunts. Upon meeting Senator Organa for the second time, she noticed when he said his daughter took after her mother, yet she failed to answer the test she suspected the words were; Leia was secretly the daughter of Anakin Skywalker and Padmé Amidala, but Tano elected to move past the subject, knowing Organa and her would need to trust each other despite each other's secrets.\\n\",\n",
              " 'As a rebel Informant code-named \"Fulcrum,\" Tano worked indirectly with various rebel cells, always with her face hidden and her voice disguised, and became somewhat pragmatic as she advised Hera Syndulla to cease searching for Kanan Jarrus to protect her crew, especially Ezra Bridger. This may suggest she developed a more discreet nature and decided overall to put the many before the few. When Tano was saved and reunited with Bridger in the World Between Worlds, she was saddened to learn of the fate of Jarrus, but disturbed by Bridger\\'s idea of saving Jarrus from dying. Drawing from her own experience of being unable to save her master, Tano successfully convinced Bridger to let Jarrus go, and they parted ways, promising to find each other again as Tano went back to Malachor and resumed her journey.\\n',\n",

At that time, she had adopted a more stoic persona. However, after the Force spirit of Skywalker gave her a final lesson and her decision to live, her personality returned to a more lively state.\\n',\n",
              " 'Tano\\'s relationship with her master was tenuous to start. Skywalker had maintained that he would never take on a Padawan learner for fear that he would be \"slowed down,\" so he was originally strongly opposed to Master Yoda\\'s assigning of the young Ahsoka to him. Tano was offended by this, and deeply hurt, but she was eager to prove herself to her new teacher. Her enthusiasm often came at odds with her brash nature, a trait shared by Skywalker himself. In fact, in part due to her youthful impulsiveness and bravery, she was the perfect Padawan for Skywalker. The two would often butt heads, each believing that they knew better than the other. During their first mission together at the Battle of Christophsis, they developed demeaning nicknames for each other; Tano gave her master the diminutive title \"Skyguy,\" while Skywalker returned the favor with the name \"Snips,\" referring to Tano\\'s snippy wit. Tano used the nickname Skyguy only because it annoyed Skywalker, although, as the war progressed, these nicknames would remain by changing into more playful terms of friendship.\\n',\n",
              " \"For all their bickering, the two developed a close relationship during the Clone Wars. Skywalker reassured his Padawan that their meeting was no accident and that it was the will of the Force for her to train under him. Their rapport made it's way onto the battlefield, with the duo competing to see who could destroy the most droids during the Second Battle of Geonosis. The master and apprentice grew increasingly reliant on each other throughout the war, taking turns rescuing each other from Separatist forces and bounty hunters. After situations where she was nearly killed, she found that she could talk to her mentor to come to terms with it. Tano's naive outlook balanced with Skywalker's cynical approach. During her time on Mortis, Tano was killed by the Son and only resurrected after Skywalker pleaded with the Father to help save her. Later, after being captured by Trandoshan hunters, Tano credited her master's teachings as the one thing that allowed her to survive.\\n\",\n",

During the mission to Lola Sayu, Tano directly disobeyed Skywalker and joined his team, believing she should be the one to decide when to put her life in danger, not her master. Later, when Tano went on the run after being accused of murder, she realized that Skywalker was the only person who would believe in her innocence and begged him to trust that she would make the right decision. Ultimately, however, Tano left the Jedi Order, knowing that she had to discover more about herself without the help of her master. Skywalker confessed to his Padawan that he too understood the desire to leave the Order, and Tano, who had become aware of a connection between her master and Senator Amidala, but had never pushed the issue, assured him that she knew.\\n',\n",

The lessons she had learned from him stayed with her in her exile; when asked by Trace Martez where she had learned to fly, the former Padawan credited her skills to \"Skywalker Academy.\" Even still, when she was approached by the Nite Owls to join in the fight against Maul, Tano feared that she would become closer to the life and master she had left behind, but knew that she must go with them to help others. As she came face-to-face with Skywalker prior to the Siege of Mandalore, she did not indulge an emotional reunion and focused her attention on convincing the Jedi to assist the Mandalorians. In their final meeting as friends, Skywalker gifted Tano with her old lightsabers, now shining with blue blades, just as his own did. Before Skywalker left, Tano allowed her emotions to be shown, thanking him for his help and wishing him luck.\\n',\n",

After Maul's capture, Tano attempted to speak with Skywalker but was unable to make contact with him. Later, she was able to feel his fall to the dark side through the Force, hearing him call out in anguish after attacking Mace Windu. She had no time to process these events before the execution of Order 66, forcing her to go into hiding.

During the battle, Tano sensed the anger and hatred emanating from the dark sider, and she was met with the realization that the individual behind Vader's mask was Skywalker. The incongruity of the two men being the same caused Tano to lose consciousness. In the aftermath of this discovery, Tano struggled to accept the truth. Although she maintained that she was unaware of the Sith Lord's identity, she secretly harbored feelings of grief and guilt, haunted by the idea that she could have helped her master in his time of need. During a mission to the Jedi Temple on Lothal, Tano was confronted by a vision of Skywalker that preyed upon these fears, blaming her for allowing Darth Vader to rise. Tano fought back against the vision, believing that there was still a way to reach her master.\\n\",\n",

Although it pained her, Tano viewed Vader as the murderer of Anakin Skywalker and vowed to avenge her master's death, going against the Jedi teachings she had learned as a child. She battled him atop the Sith Temple, defending the Padawan Ezra Bridger. As the Temple began to collapse, Tano damaged Vader's mask, revealing the scorched face of Skywalker. The sight of her master forced her to pause. Feeling the guilt from leaving him years ago, Tano refused to leave Vader and continued to duel as her friends escaped.

In 9 ABY, she refused to train the youngling Grogu because she recognized that the child\\'s attachment to his father figure Din Djarin made him vulnerable to the same fears as Anakin. Tano could not bring herself to separate the infant from Djarin, vowing to not set him down the same self-destructive path as her old friend.

She even advised him in the training of Grogu, such as telling the young Skywalker to trust his instincts, and accepted his decision to train the youngling despite her own lack of desire to do so. She would even declare that being by Skywalker\\'s side was the safest place in the galaxy for a young Force-sensitive like Grogu. While she still did not consider herself a Jedi, she had faith that Skywalker would create a \"great school\" and kept Djarin from seeing Grogu, as per Jedi rules on attachment.

Nevertheless, Tano more commonly utilized Jar'Kai, particularly when facing multiple opponents such as when she engaged the much more experienced Skywalker and Kenobi on Mortis. Whilst fleeing from clones after being framed for murder, Tano lost her second lightsaber and was forced to use only her main lightsaber to fight Barriss Offee. Her duel against Offee showed that she had become too reliant on her second lightsaber, something she had in common with Asajj Ventress, and though she did put up a considerable fight, Offee overwhelmed her.\\n\",\n",

Instead of fleeing after exchanging only a few blows, Tano held her ground and gave the Younglings time to escape before escaping with them. By the time of the Siege of Mandalore, Tano demonstrated highly advanced skills in lightsaber combat as evidenced by her prolonged duel with the powerful former Sith Lord Maul. Although Maul successfully disarmed Tano at the conclusion of their duel, she turned Maul's own attack against him in order to defeat him nonetheless.\\n\",\n",

Even in extremely close-quarter fighting, she was able to defend herself despite being surrounded by multiple troopers. Thanks to her training, she knew she could fight while blinded, yet she recognized needing to do that and fight without lightsabers would be a challenge.

During the mission to Malachor, Tano again proved capable of fighting several Inquisitors at once and even disarmed the Fifth Brother and destroyed his lightsaber. During the same mission, Tano again proved capable of dueling to a stalemate with the former Sith Lord Maul before breaking off the fight to rescue Ezra Bridger.

At the beginning of her apprenticeship, Tano was capable of telekinetic feats as evidenced during the Battle of Christophsis, where she pulled down a large wall in order to save Skywalker from a group of retail droids. In another instance, Tano strongly pushed Ventress and flung her back some distance in order to save the life of Luminara Unduli. By the end of the Clone Wars, Tano's telekinetic abilities advanced to the point that she was able to hold Maul aloft high above the city of Sundari and could use the Force to prevent a small starship from taking off. During Order 66, she was able to use the Force to guide her two lightsabers in a circle to cut an escape path for her and Rex.

The kyber crystals within, as well as their mountings, came from the lightsaber of the Inquisitor Sixth Brother, whom Tano had defeated on Raada. Tano found the crystals familiar, and speculated they had been looted from the Jedi Temple after the Order's fall.

Supervising director Dave Filoni and executive producer George Lucas decided that including a Padawan was important, and Lucas wanted her to be Anakin Skywalker's Padawan. He explained that she would give Skywalker someone to teach and her inclusion would create a dynamic between her, Skywalker, and Obi-Wan Kenobi. As of 2005, the character was named Ashla, a reference to an early name for the light side of the Force when Lucas was developing Star Wars, and later canonized as the Lasat name of the Force. Ashla is also the name of one Togruta Jedi youngling who appeared in Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones.

Tano\\'s story is a major part of Skywalker\\'s story and his fall to the dark side. Indeed, Filoni himself noted as such in the \"Obi-Wan Undercover\" featurette for Star Wars: The Clone Wars The Complete Season Four: in teasing the story of Tano leaving the Jedi, he noted Season Five included a story that helped explain why Skywalker believed the Jedi Order had betrayed his trust. However, even though there were ideas for her to die during The Clone Wars, Filoni did not want Tano\\'s character to just exist as another factor that pushed Skywalker to the dark side.

In an early version of the script for the episode, Ahsoka visited the young bounty hunter Boba Fett in his prison cell in an attempt to learn information upon his former ally Aurra Sing.

When Wilhuff Tarkin enters Ahsoka\\'s cell in the Clone Wars episode \"The Jedi Who Knew Too Much,\" it is framed as a homage to when Darth Vader enters Leia Organa\\'s cell aboard the Death Star in Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope. Similar to this, his interaction with her while in her cell was meant to mirror his interaction with Leia shortly before he commands the destruction of Alderaan. Ahsoka\\'s leap from the water pipe in the Clone Wars episode \"The Jedi Who Knew Too Much\" is an homage to a similar scene in 1993 film The Fugitive.

Djarin then gathered his allies—Dune, Kuiil, and a re-programmed IG-11—and met with Karga on Nevarro. Djarin and his allies entered the city and fought the Imperials led by Moff Gideon, later retreating to the Tribe\\'s covert after facing heavy opposition. The Mandalorian, known as \"the Armorer,\" who had remained in the hideout after the covert\\'s attempted relocation, tasked Djarin with returning Grogu to his people and declared the creation of his clan. After dealing with Gideon and his remaining Imperials, Djarin departed the planet with the infant and began his search for Grogu\\'s people.\\n',\n",

Eventually, the pair traveled to Corvus, where they encountered a former Jedi named Ahsoka Tano, who was able to communicate with Grogu through the Force, revealing the child's name and history to the Mandalorian. After Djarin assisted Tano with liberating the city of Calodan from an Imperial magistrate named Morgan Elsbeth, Tano gifted Elsbeth's beskar spear to Djarin and directed him to Tython, a planet where Grogu could reach out to any other Jedi willing to train him. On Tython, as Grogu was attempting to reach a Jedi, Djarin met Boba Fett, the clone of another Mandalorian, who wanted his armor back in exchange for not harming Grogu. However, before Djarin could give the armor to Fett, Gideon's Imperial remnant attacked and captured Grogu.\\n\",\n",
              " \"After receiving his armor, Fett agreed to help Djarin rescue Grogu, and, with the help of Cara Dune, Migs Mayfeld, and Fennec Shand, located Gideon's light cruiser. Djarin, alongside Kryze, Dune, Shand, and Koska Reeves stormed the cruiser and found Grogu. In the process, though, Djarin unintentionally became a potential heir to the title of Mand'alor after defeating Gideon in combat and claiming the Darksaber. As the team attempted to escape, they were cornered by a platoon of Dark Troopers before being rescued by Luke Skywalker, the Jedi that Grogu had reached out to. When Skywalker finally destroyed the Dark Troopers, he left the ship with Grogu, but not before Djarin said his goodbyes to the youngling and promised they would see each other again.\\n\",\n",
              " 'With Grogu now training in the ways of the Jedi, Djarin returned to bounty hunting. On one mission, he learned of the location of his old tribe, and paid a visit to them. Djarin asked the Armorer to forge the beskar spear into a chainmail for Grogu, whom he intended to visit. The Armorer trained Djarin with the Darksaber, before Paz Vizsla challenged him to a duel, as Paz was the descendant of its original creator. Djarin and Vizsla dueled, though Djarin ultimately won. However, he was banished from the ways of the Mandalorian after the Armorer discovered that he had removed his helmet. Djarin soon visited Tatooine, having previously contacted Peli Motto to request the creation of a new ship. Djarin was then contacted by Shand, who requested his service for the Fett gotra in their upcoming battle against the Pyke Syndicate.\\n',\n",
              " \"Before aiding Fett, Djarin decided to pay a visit to Skywalker's temple on Ossus where he was greeted by R2-D2. Tano explained to him the struggles his presence would cause Grogu in his training, resulting in Djarin departing the planet, but not before asking Tano to give the armor to Grogu. Skywalker sensed that Grogu missed Djarin, and gave him the choice to either continue as a Jedi or return to Djarin, with Grogu choosing the latter. Meanwhile, Djarin assembled the people of Freetown to act as foot soldiers for the Fett gotra. The Pyke Syndicate soon blew up the Sanctuary, a key attraction of Mos Espa, causing war to break out. Djarin assisted Fett throughout the war, promising to be with him until they both fell. They fought off the Pyke enforcers together, before being reinforced by the people of Freetown. In the ensuing struggle against the Pykes' Scorpenek annihilator droids, Motto reunited Grogu with Djarin. Fett's rancor soon went on a rampage, which Djarin attempted to stop. Following the battle, Fett thanked Djarin before he departed the planet with Grogu.\\n\",\n",

The village came under attack by Separatist battle droids at some point during the Clone Wars, with Djarin and his family caught in the crossfire. While the droids slaughtered the people of the village, his mother and father hid him under a hatch before being killed in an explosion themselves shortly after. The hatch was then opened by a B2-series super battle droid, which attempted to fire on the child. Before it could, however, the battle droid was destroyed by a Mandalorian warrior of the Death Watch movement. As more Death Watch Warriors arrived and fought the remaining battle droids, the warrior flew away using his jetpack while carrying Djarin, rescuing him. He was then taken in as a foundling by the Mandalorians, who trained him in the Fighting Corps and took care of him. He grew up on Concordia.\\n',\n",

By the time following the Great Purge of Mandalore, he was part of the Tribe, which operated on the planet Nevarro, and acquired Mandalorian armor. Unknown to Djarin, the Tribe followed the orthodox ways of the Children of the Watch. Due to this, once he had received his helmet, he ceased to remove it in front of anyone else, for if he did, he would not be allowed to put it back on again or be considered a true Mandalorian, which was a tradition practiced by the members of the Children of the Watch.\\n',\n",

He became known simply as \"the Mandalorian,\" or \"Mando\" for short, to those outside of the Tribe. The Razor Crest—an ST-70 military patrol gunship that predated the Imperial Era—served as his personal transport. During the rise of the New Republic, Djarin traveled across the galaxy\\'s Outer Rim Territories collecting bounties as a member of the Bounty Hunters\\' Guild. Quickly becoming one of the guild\\'s best hunters, he developed a reputation for being an expensive, yet famous and formidable, bounty hunter in an increasingly dangerous galaxy. At some point, Djarin had worked alongside criminal Ranzar Malk and the Twi\\'lek mercenaries Xi\\'an and Qin, who were also siblings. One such mission was on Alzoc III.

The Mythrol was harassed by three trawlers when Djarin entered the bar, drawing the trawlers' attention away from his target. As Djarin made his way to the counter, one of the human trawlers approached him and claimed he had spilled his drink, speaking in Huttese. The bartender translated his statement, but Djarin remained silent. As the bartender made another drink, the trawler's Quarren and cyborg human companions made their way to the counter, slowly surrounding Djarin. The trawler then asked if the armor he was wearing was real beskar steel, before the Quarren nicked Djarin's chest plate with a knife.\\n\",\n",

The other human trawler attempted to stab Djarin with his knife, but Djarin grabbed his arm and redirected the blade to his back. When the Quarren attempted to escape the bar, Djarin used his whipcord launcher to pull him back towards him and shot the controls for the door, allowing it to close on the Quarren and bisect him. After dealing with the trawlers, Djarin approached the Mythrol, who thanked him for saving his life. However, Djarin displayed the Mythrol\\'s holopuck in front of him. The Mythrol, realizing the Mandalorian\\'s true intentions, claimed there was a misunderstanding, but Djarin threatened him, stating he could either bring him in \"warm\" or \"cold.\"\\n',\n",
              " 'After the Mythrol obliged, Djarin took him back towards the Razor Crest. When approaching a Kubaz ferryman, the Mandalorian requested transportation to his gunship. The Kubaz then played a flute and summoned a landspeeder driven by a droid. Djarin refused to accept a transport driven by a droid and instead accepted a much less luxurious speeder with a human pilot after flipping the ferryman some extra credits. The pilot drove the Mandalorian and the Mythrol to the Razor Crest.\\n',\n",

Djarin pulled the Mythrol out of the way of the beast as they boarded the ship to take off. Although the ravinak attempted to prevent the gunship from taking off by holding on to the landing gear, Djarin stunned the creature using his Amban phase-pulse blaster and allowed his ship to escape. While making their way to Nevarro, Djarin remained silent while the Mythrol attempted to spark a conversation with him. He then allowed the Mythrol to use the Razor Crest's vacc tube in the lower deck.

When Djarin refused Karga's initial payment of Imperial credits, Karga offered Calamari Flan instead at half the value, which Djarin accepted. When they discussed Djarin's next job, the bounty hunter attempted to take all of Karga's pucks, but Karga stated that there were other members of the Guild and that those were the only pucks he currently owned.\\n\",\n",

As they conversed, Djarin was unsatisfied when he learned of the value of Karga\\'s highest paying bounty, stating that the reward would not cover the cost of fuel. Karga then offered him a job which required meeting the client \"face to face,\" stating that no puck was provided.

The Client told Djarin that Karga had called him \"the best in the parsec.\" While speaking to the bounty hunter, his scientist, Doctor Penn Pershing, entered the room and startled Djarin, prompting him to draw his weapons. The stormtroopers trained their own blasters at him. The Client introduced Pershing to the Mandalorian, before ordering Djarin to lower his blaster. Djarin told the Client to order his stormtroopers to lower their blasters first, before being told that Karga also stated that the bounty hunter\\'s services were expensive. Djarin lowered his weapons when the Client ended the standoff by signaling the troopers to lower their blasters.\\n',\n",

The Client acknowledged how complicated bounty hunting could be, and stated that the asset\\'s termination was acceptable for a lower reward. When Djarin demanded the puck of the target, the Client forwent the traditional method of bounty pucks and revealed that he could only offer the asset\\'s tracking fob. Pershing provided the fob to Djarin, before the bounty hunter asked for the chain code. The Client stated he could only share the age of the asset, fifty years, and its last known location.\\n',\n",

She told him it was gathered during the Great Purge of Mandalore, an event which saw the deaths of most of the Mandalorian people, and added that it was beneficial that it was returned to the Tribe. Djarin was asked if his signet had been revealed, and she replied that it hadn\\'t yet. When the Armorer said that the excess would sponsor many foundlings, Djarin recounted that he had been one in the past.

Djarin then attempted to tame the foal one last time and successfully hopped on its back without startling it. Afterwards, Kuiil guided the bounty hunter to the asset's location in the hope that the ensuing battle would lead to the deaths of the mercenaries whose presence disrupted the peace on Arvala-7.

Djarin got up and revealed that he was also a member of the Guild, reasoning that they could be more effective by working together to acquire the asset and split the reward. After IG-11 agreed, however, more mercenaries began storming out of the buildings and soon pinned them down. While taking cover behind a speeder, the bounty hunter found the building where the asset was located using his fob, and the two immediately rushed to take cover behind the building's pillars.

Djarin then ordered the assassin droid to draw the turret's fire away from the Mandalorian while he hijacked the E-Web, utilizing it to kill the rest of the mercenaries.

Djarin questioned the infant's age, to which the droid replied his species may have aged considerably slower than others. As IG-11 raised his blaster to kill the infant, Djarin stopped him and stated that they should bring him in alive.

During the negotiations, the Jawas requested his beskar armor, to which the Mandalorian refused in Jawaese.

Following this, the two sat in the common house to speak to each other regarding their respective intentions. Dune revealed her military background and stated she was attempting to find sanctuary from a bounty placed on her after she deserted the New Republic.

He accepted their credits, and ordered the two farmers to help him unpack his supplies. He later approached Dune, and handed her the credits in return for her aid in protecting the village.

The villager then introduced her daughter and explained that the village did not receive many visitors, before the two left Djarin's room. Later that day, Omera provided food to Djarin, who reluctantly allowed Winta to feed and take Grogu with her outside. Omera asked the Mandalorian when he had last removed his helmet; he remarked that he removed it yesterday. Omera clarified her question, asking if anyone had ever seen his face. Djarin replied that he hadn't shown his face to anyone since his childhood after the Mandalorians took him in following the Separatist attack on his home, before citing the Way of the Mandalore.

After the villagers refused to leave their home, Djarin and Dune eventually agreed to train the villagers to fight the tribe. As they helped to train the villagers, they also instructed them to create traps and barricades designed to hinder and destroy the AT-ST.

Dune and the Mandalorian engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the Klatooinians, rushing out of the tent right before the explosive was detonated.

Dune facetiously expressed that he could abandon his Mandalorian way of life and settle on Sorgan with Omera and raise Grogu.

This action was met with frustration by Peli Motto, the mechanic who managed the bay and owned the droids.

Djarin was then greeted by rookie bounty hunter Toro Calican, who stated that he had a job with which Djarin could assist him. The Mandalorian initially refused due to the dangerous reputation of the bounty, the assassin Fennec Shand. He finally accepted the job when Calican, who wished to join the Bounty Guild, further pleaded and offered all his credits.

While conversing, Malk explained that Djarin was hired to assist four other crew members in rescuing another of their associates captured by a rival syndicate. Unbeknownst to Djarin at the time, the prisoner was his former ally, the Twi'lek Qin, who was imprisoned due to the Mandalorian's actions while on a mission with the Twi'lek.

Accompanying Mayfeld, the team leader introduced Djarin to the other team members on the mission, beginning with the Devaronian Burg, who ridiculed the Mandalorian upon seeing him. Mayfeld then introduced the droid Q9-0, whom they nicknamed \"Zero.\" Djarin, who had only been introduced to three members of the team at that point, asked where the fourth member was.

Xi\\'an then revealed that the ship\\'s personnel purely consisted of droids, appealing to his hatred of droids.

During a brief standoff with Burg, the Devaronian questioned why Djarin was chosen for the job.

The Mandalorian was informed by the Armorer that he was tasked with taking care of Grogu in accordance with the Creed, and that Grogu was to be reunited with its own species. Djarin was gifted a mudhorn's signet by the Armorer, who declared the creation of his clan, which consisted of Djarin and Grogu. The Mandalorian was also given a customary jetpack. As such, Djarin had risen in rank amongst the fallen covert, with the signet and jetpack also proving he was a true Mandalorian warrior.\\n\",\n",

Thanks to Dune shooting the rocks and setting the boat free, the group boarded it, unintentionally activating the resident droid to ferry them out. Through his visor, Djarin identified the heat signatures of a group of stormtroopers waiting to ambush the group at the mouth of the tunnel, and he began to create a plan of escape alongside the others. IG-11 announced his intent to sacrifice himself and ensure Grogu's survival, as the droid saw no scenario where he and Grogu would both survive. Djarin insisted that he stay and help them fight, as the Mandalorian had come to accept the droid as an ally, but conceded.\\n\",\n",

When IG-11 reached the Imperials, the droid activated his self-destruct to kill them all. Outside the tunnel, the group came under fire from Gideon's TIE fighter. While the Moff circled around for another volley, Djarin activated his jetpack, flew upwards, and used his whipcord to pull himself towards the fighter. Struggling to hold on to the TIE, Djarin placed two grav charges on the TIE, which damaged the ship's wing and caused it to crash into the landscape.\\n\",\n",

While activating his ship, he discovered the infant possessed the mythosaur necklace he had given to Dune earlier.

Keresh initially offered Djarin the information in exchange for a bet—if his Gamorrean fighter won the match, he would give the information, whereas if he lost, Djarin would hand over his armor. Djarin refused, prompting Keresh to instead have his grunts attack him. Djarin made quick work of them, and chased Keresh down, stringing him up on a street light.

Vanth offered Djarin a drink, taking a seat and removing his helmet, much to Djarin\\'s surprise. Upon the revelation that Vanth was not a Mandalorian, Djarin immediately demanded that Vanth hand the armor over.

When Motto inquired if he had killed the Mandalorian he had met, Djarin said he merely acquired his armor. Djarin then forked over 500 credits to Dr. Mandible for information on another group of Mandalorians.

However, he eventually relented and plotted the course for Trask with Frog Lady sitting next to him in the Razor Crest. Midway in deep space, Djarin encountered two New Republic X-wing pilots, Trapper Wolf and Carson Teva, informing him that his ship was involved in a prisoner breakout and that he needed to hand in his transponder. In order to get away from this arrest, Djarin blasted off towards Maldo Kreis ahead of them, pursued closely by the X-wings.

He later took Grogu and marched into the cold caves, only to find the Frog Lady taking a hot bath in a natural spring with her eggs. The place was surrounded by small white eggs, intriguing Grogu. Once again, he thought with his stomach and ate one of them.

The Razor Crest was towed out of the water onto a landing pad, where Djarin paid a Mon Calamari dock worker one thousand credits to repair the Crest enough to be able to fly again.

Fortunately, three Mandalorians arrived and rescued the infant and Djarin, eliminating the traitors in the process. The leader of this small crew was revealed to be Bo-Katan Kryze, rightful heir to the throne of Mandalore. The two other fighters on her side were Axe Woves and Koska Reeves. Djarin was offended as they took off their helmets, declaring they were not real Mandalorians.\\n',\n",

Djarin, confused by what he had learned, angrily declined their aid, as he did not trust them and thought those who did not follow the Mandalorian Code were not Mandalorians at all. He took off with the Child and returned to shore, leaving the three warriors behind. However, later that night, they arrived again to save him from another group of angry Quarren.\\n',\n",

Kryze decided to make a deal: if Djarin helped them take down an Imperial frigate, she would guide him to the way of whom he searched for. The assignment was to steal weapons shipments from an Imperial Gozanti-class cruiser. Djarin agreed, and asked for the Frog Lady and her husband to keep the infant during the mission.\\n',\n",

Djarin complained about the deal's change, but Kryze reminded him that if he wanted the information about the Jedi, he had to help them take over the cruiser. The officer received a holographic transmission of Moff Gideon, ordering him to plunge the ship into the ocean to eliminate the Mandalorians.

The Imperial henchman electrocuted himself before revealing anything, leaving Kryze clueless about the saber's whereabouts. Nevertheless, they successfully took over the cruiser, and Djarin asked for information on the Jedi. Kryze told him to fly to the city of Calodan on the forest planet of Corvus, and to search for Ahsoka Tano. Djarin thanked Kryze and got off the cruiser.

Upon arrival, Djarin and Grogu were greeted by Greef Karga and Cara Dune, who had since become the town's new marshal. Karga tasked two workers with fixing the Crest and welcomed back Djarin and Grogu. After reluctantly allowing Karga to drop off Grogu at the former cantina, which was now a school, Djarin was led to a building where the Mythrol he had previously captured was waiting. After an awkward reunion, Karga explained the mission that he wanted Djarin to help them with, as he had time to spare until his ship was fixed.

Djarin nodded and was allowed to enter the city, but once inside, he was shunned by the villagers, who fled from him when he tried to gather information, save for one who asked him not to talk to them.

Tano jumped over a branch, causing Djarin to detach his whipcord, but before the fight continued, Djarin informed Tano that Bo-Katan sent him, and she noticed the Child behind him and stood down. She then read the thoughts of the Child, sharing his origins as a Jedi youngling who survived the Purge as well as his name: Grogu. She explained that the Jedi Master Yoda was the only other member of his species she knew of, and that the Force was the energy that produced Grogu's powers.

Tano, however, recognized the fear and attachment to Djarin in Grogu, and refused to train him, citing what those feelings could do to \"the best of us.\" Before she left, Djarin told her he was sent to kill her, and offered instead to take down the magistrate in exchange for the child\\'s training.

As Lang attempted to close the distance while talking to Djarin, he stopped and agreed to lower his weapon after seeing Tano enter the magistrate's residence. However, as he was putting down his heavy blaster, Lang drew another blaster to kill Djarin, but the Mandalorian fired first and killed him, and soon after eliminated an HK-87 assassin droid on a rooftop attempting a sneak attack.\\n\",\n",

Djarin rushed to meet the potential danger to buy Grogu some time to finish his task and encountered Boba Fett, who had been tracking him since he acquired his armor from Vanth. The bounty hunter asked that his armor to be returned to him. Djarin was skeptical of his claim to it, and asked as to why he shouldn't simply gun down the mysterious hunter. Fett answered by showing his sniper, Fennec Shand, who Djarin had gone after on Tatooine, aiming at Grogu. To avoid a needless fight, Boba ordered Shand to stand down and, after Djarin hesitantly took off his jetpack and set down his own rifle, began to talk peacefully. Shand explained that Fett saved her from certain death, showing the cybernetics in her torso, and she now was in his service.

He supported Shand with a hail of whistling birds and shielded her from blasts with his armor. Once backed into a corner, Fett used a grav charge to defeat multiple troopers, now donning his beskar armor, which he had retrieved from the Razor Crest.

Djarin, Mayfeld, and Dune ambushed an HCVw A9.2 juggernaut transport, taking the armor of neutralized Juggernaut Pilots as both a means of disguise.

He took out the first skiff with a pirate's own thermal detonator, and shot one more pirate from the next before his blaster failed. He engaged in melee combat with the rest, ordering Mayfeld to speed up until he slowed back down to keep the load stable.

However, Djarin decided to take the data stick and go in anyway, ultimately removing his helmet in the name of saving Grogu to let the machine scan him. By doing so, Djarin became an apostate instead of a Mandalorian by the rules of the Children of the Watch. He quickly retrieved the information on Gideon's vessel, but was stopped by Hess, who asked for his designation. Djarin hesitated, but Mayfeld bailed him out by acting like he was hard of hearing after an incident on Taanab before claiming to have business to attend to.

Pershing confirmed as much, but the co-pilot grabbed him, holding a blaster to his head and shooting the pilot when he attempted to negotiate with Cara Dune for his freedom. The co-pilot explained to Dune and Djarin that Pershing was a top-tier New Republic target, a clone engineer, and if he died because of them, Dune would wish she never left Alderaan.

On Slave I, Kryze briefed the others on Gideon's cruiser, saying that at the height of the Empire, such a ship would have carried hundreds of troopers, but now only held a small fraction of that. Pershing noted, however, that Gideon carried a platoon of dark troopers aboard his vessel.

As both ships jumped into hyperspace, Kryze demanded that Gideon surrender to her. Both starships dropped out of hyperspace near Gideon's cruiser, and Slave I fired on the shuttle to stage Kryze's request for emergency docking. Communications officer Elia Kane acknowledged the request, but ordered them to stay clear of the cruiser's launch tube while two TIE fighters launched from the cruiser.

Djarin reached Grogu's cell, dispatching the two troopers guarding it with the beskar spear and facing Gideon holding the Darksaber over the Child. Gideon ordered him to drop his blaster and explained that whoever held the Darksaber held the right to the Mandalorian throne.

Just then, another alarm sounded, and a lone X-wing fighter entered the hangar bay. Bo-Katan asked them to identify themselves, and Grogu sensed something through the Force. The dark troopers stopped their attack on the door and turned around. Kryze watched on the monitor as a hooded figure disembarked from the X-wing and walked through the ship, destroying dark troopers with a green-bladed lightsaber. With his captors distracted, Gideon grabbed the blaster and shot at Bo-Katan, knocking her to the ground.

Djarin believed Grogu did not want to leave, but the Jedi revealed that he just wanted Djarin's permission.

Djarin tried to do it peacefully, but Baiz and his workers fought him. Djarin was able to kill Baiz and several of his workers with the Darksaber. In the process, however, Djarin wounded his leg with the weapon. He then took Baiz's head and was able to convince the workers to let him go in exchange for Baiz's New Republic credits.\\n\",\n",

Djarin was able to find several symbols that led him to the covert.

When Djarin asked her about Bo-Katan Kryze, she claimed that Kryze receiving the blade as a gift rather than earning in combat is part of what led Mandalore to its destruction by the empire. The Armorer asked how he obtained the beskar spear, and said that its existence put Mandalorians at risk, as it could pierce beskar armor. Djarin requested to reforge it into a gift for Grogu. Despite the Armorer noting that such attachment was virtue to Mandalorians but vice to Jedi, she agreed and reforged the spear's head, wrapping the crafted gift in a knapsack.\\n\",\n",

However, when the Armorer asked both if they had removed their helmets, Vizsla told the Armorer that he had not, but Din reluctantly confessed he had. The Armorer then announced to Djarin that unless he bathed in the Living Waters of the Mines of Mandalore, he was no longer Mandalorian.\\n',\n",

He then inquired Ahsoka about her willingness to let Skywalker train Grogu instead of doing it herself, to which she replied it was the Jedi's choice. As they walked, Ahsoka led him to a hill, atop which Luke was meditating with his new apprentice, and they watched at a distance.

Tano asked for his permission to deliver the gift herself, prompting Djarin's sad response that he had come so far to see Grogu only to not be able to do so when he was so close. She stated that Grogu missed him greatly, but their reunion would be a disruption of his already difficult training; Din yielded and gave her the knapsack, asking her to ensure his protection and returning to his starfighter.

After a brief reunion, the Scorpenek droid pursuing them was able to take out the rickshaw droid, sending its occupants flying. Djarin protected Grogu from a hard landing as a roar, coming from a rancor, made itself known. The rancor fiercely attacked the Scorpenek, damaging its shielding, allowing Djarin to move in for the kill.

In a meeting between Favreau and Dave Filoni, they exchanged ideas and drawings for a Mandalorian show. Filoni combined his knowledge of Mandalorian history with Favreau's concept of a lone gunslinger.\\n\",\n",
              " 'After being recruited by Favreau, Pascal prepared for the role by watching classic Clint Eastwood Westerns and Akira Kurosawa\\'s samurai films. In an interview with USA Today, he stated, \"Any time I had a question or a physical doubt about a moment, I was always like, \\'What would Clint do? How would he shrug this off? How would he walk away from this?\\'\" While Pascal served as the voice of the titular character for the majority of the season, Brendan Wayne, Lateef Crowder, and Barry Lowin served as stunt doubles. Aidan Bertola portrayed the character as a young boy in flashbacks. Stephen Jackson served as a stand-in in \"Chapter 5: The Gunslinger.\" As of February 2024, according to Mandalorian actress Emily Swallow, Wayne is the main suit actor for Djarin—crediting Djarin\\'s cowboy-like walk to Wayne\\'s heritage as John Wayne\\'s grandson—and Pascal only does the character\\'s voice. The third major player in bringing Djarin to life according to Swallow is Lateef Crowder, whom she described as a \"fighting machine.\" That the three were able to work so well together and bring Djarin to life is an art in-and-of-itself in Swallow\\'s eyes.\\n',\n",
              " 'At the beginning, Pascal established Djarin\\'s physical specificity in some ways. He observed and picked up from what Crowder and Wayne did when they were wearing the armor. Pascal said that wearing the armor was \"like putting on a head-to-toe glove with weights on it.\" He said wearing the helmet is like going blind due to the lack of peripheral vision and his breath fogging up the narrow slit. Despite this, Pascal felt powerful and like a protector when he wore the armor. Over the course of The Mandalorian and The Book of Boba Fett, the costume was finessed and made more comfortable, but there were still problems seeing in the helmet.\\n',\n",
              " 'The real name of the titular character was revealed by Pascal in an interview conducted by ScreenSlam released on the same day as Chapter 1 of the first season, with the website spelling the name \"Dyn Jarren.\" He was finally named in the show in the eighth chapter of the first season, with the subtitles spelling \"Din Djarin.\"\\n',\n",
              " \"A Mandalorian helmet that heavily resembles the one worn by Djarin is in Dok-Ondar's Den of Antiquities in the Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge theme park. The helmet is hung next to an Amban phase-pulse blaster, the same blaster model Djarin used. However, after a fan suggested a timeline as to how the Mandalorian's gear ended up at the Den of Antiquities, Matt Martin of the Lucasfilm Story Group stated he did not believe it was Djarin's helmet. At Disney's D23 Expo in 2022, it was announced that Djarin and Grogu would be included as characters at Galaxy's Edge.\\n\",\n",
              " 'On December 2, 2020, Djarin was added as an outfit in Fortnite\\'s fifth season of its second chapter, alongside cosmetics based on both Grogu and the Razor Crest. The outfit features Djarin\\'s beskar armor. Additionally, eliminating an NPC player of Djarin in-game rewarded the player with Djarin\\'s amban phase-pulse blaster, as well as his jetpack. \"The Journey of Din Djarin,\" an article by Kristin Baver in Star Wars Insider 216, stated that Djarin became Grogu\\'s adopted father prior to the events of The Mandalorian Season Three. However \"Chapter 24: The Return\" featured Djarin formally adopting Grogu during Season Three, not before. The official Star Wars Japan Twitter account claimed that a past connection between Bo-Katan Kryze and Djarin would be revealed in The Mandalorian Season Three. However, no such past connection was revealed in Season Three.\\n']"

Vader had allied himself with the ancient Sith Lord Darth Momin—whose spirit inhabited a mask he had worn many years prior to his downfall—in an attempt to revive his long-dead wife, Padmé Amidala. The two managed to construct a portal within a Sith cave below the fortress, which allowed Momin to resurrect himself but was once again killed by Vader shortly after. Now having gained access to the portal, Vader entered and began to explore, receiving many visions granted to him by the dark side of the Force.

You have taken your first step into a larger world.” There are lots of directions to go from here. LangChain takes the complexity away from working with AI prompt engineering. I know Elasticsearch has many other roles to play here as long term memory for generative AI, so I am very excited to see what comes out of this quickly changing space.\n",
